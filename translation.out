the ernst avisan of that in a development sano are important addition the details that also delegates as why example account a summer fija for the desayuno in family 
in chequia not anticipated only the of the families of escolares desayunan to the same summer 
in the majority of the families every one desayuna only 
but what worse was descubrir that in the of the wells not the desayuna nothing 
the desayuno is without however the basis of a dieta diaria direction 
the study intends that in the families of children obesos the consumen with many more often the insanas eurocents fritas 
almost all irrespective the shifted beben to dover refrescos dulces

the estilista has of be also a business psicólogo sostienen the qualifications 
in the article introductorio how aprenden the estilistas already i quejé a little of that the lessons iniciales already shut quite cargadas 
not keen not idea of how iría contempt 
conferencias of three qualifications the ramo how vestir to personajes problemáticos and addition a seminar on how works in the world the entertainment 
and will worse 
strides more car are the exámenes late more information and tasks practices us aguardan 
and although the graduate the implemented every saturday and sunday already not suits a alfiler 
are time we automobile with the bnfl alena in the graduate not there no man on how vestir to the wife that not has a simetría perfecta 
and so is the great majority 
someone is cuellicorto someone has a consistent estilizada without the curvas adecuadas and someone indigenous sobrepeso 
the estilista has of know suavizar ópticamente few shuffle anchos alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas defined 
us have meijer certain trucos on how done underline the service of women the sort of jennifer lópez of pechos and caderas enormous but cintura portuguese and the same time not vestirla of a way too desafiante 
if why example the difference between the cintura and the caderas is distasteful that the board or the pantalones not the adaptan benefiting the benefiting proper coser the less a piece of tela extra to measure 
without certainly not the arrepentirán because the laundry that sienta ronald is impagable 
with a board to measure the sentirá much better that with a that not for of stuck levantarse baila in the cintura etc 
the service estilizado the can afford vestir laundry with pliegues adornos bordados or drapeados 
there incarceration many types of register prevailing and of cuerpos so that am contenta of that explanations of whole the week for curb order in my memory whole this information 
and even so i afraid that with the task asignada already i more that of familiar 
to every el in the graduate the you have allocated two famosos to the that send diseñar two vestuarios one for the day and another for the night 
there that account in account the aspect current the harmonisation of coups that the adecue to the person in issue 
i has tocado quot vestir quot to miranda kerr perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victoria apos s secret 
grito why competence for me is much better that why example britney spears or christina aguilera that stoning just engordado few satisfied kilos why favour unblemished in account the exageración or the jovencísima selena gómez 
the vestidos we that recortarlos of the rigorous or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos for after elaborarlos gráficamente 
the moodboard that is as the burn the results completely voice addition our harmonisation personal and our relationship with the shaping gráfico 
is important also reminded in the part gráfica the estilismo 
the estilista why therefore not viste only liquidated but that also the discussion why example of the pages of products in the rigorous of issues begun as trends bolsos abrigos etc 
of everything bad us objections the estilista and diseñador mario kameník 
but everything this already go for the sunday 
the estilista has of account a vision warming 
the three attend ernst animaron the conference the saturday with register on everything sort of cuerpos 
the estilista honza pokorný the diseñador of coups jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of coups ben renč 
jakub us recordó that the coups is a ilusión and the estilista should saberle advantage party to this 
and a business estilista knows work with a same prenda of vestir of belonging prevailing 
the variabilidad is in this case fundamental 
so the perhaps gabardina or as petroleum in english trench coat the can vestir to what clásico with vaqueros and camiseta but also fund for vestir the service desnudo with boots of tacón and fotografiarlo as if laughing in actually a vestido 
or well enough arremangarla and top the bottleneck for obtain a image entirely turns 
quot jugad with bad quot us insistió 
what that more valoro is the follows council quot for moreover to work ago require that first conozcáis all the overhauling quot 
quot further already podéis romperlas quot said jakub 
why end i go clear why what memorizamos all these fórmulas what the combina with what why what if further find that in the rigorous of coups us plasticisers results harassment 
that without speak of the desfiles 
thank the fotógrafo ben know that a estilista has that account more types of laundry in the reserve of the that intended fotografiar 
so for a history of coups that pacifist ten pages why therefore ten outfits there that account preparadas listas for use the less fifteen 
and addition that the fotos the laundry works in combination with other prendas all them different to the that the usan in the actually 
everything bad there that tenerlo in account to the summer of diseñar the outfit 
honza pokorný us aseguró that the image and the harmonisation suponen them quebec in many cases the half the success 
enough shoulders to madonna that not is precisely a cantante extraordinaria but the image and the márquetin have done of she a star world 
in chequia why the moment not there still a trend clear to use the services of the estilistas 
until the personajes famosos also what museum pointless i bastan my skills my aspect derivatives not has distasteful importance 
and when someone us pida our services there that account in account that is very likely that us indiquen a talla very turns to the destroy real although 
further only go guglear and averiguar if the rigorous the heart already have written on the issue if a certain celebridad has engordado adelgazado etc 
the sunday honza and mario us insistieron in that the estilista not you enough orientarse in the coups but that has that understand of outfit 
during its work on everything the must mehdi with the people to the that viste why what that is fundamental be a business psicólogo 
knows panshir to the people not the ago of less defiende their opinions 
quot when a bnfl os contrata for that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and the what completéis with prendas fine not podéis coger and tirar everything what that had and say quot huy what total quot quot 
quot encontrad the less a couple of things that podáis ponderar and recomendar for that someone the the quickly curb quot says mario 
him same also us prepared that everything must caber in the southwest quot placovka quot is say the sweets of work 
this the fija around of the cintura and the have hence all the herramientas defined 
are objetos as tijeras as tijeras quitapelusas or imperdibles there also hilo of nailon that you fund the estilista during the session of fotos of products such that bolsos or gorros pinzas special of enganche of prendas why comes if this outside greater the alfileres and another sort of enganches not are excess therefore even dañar the tejido or a game of costura 
for not quedarnos in the escucha pasiva and curb something in practice we lessons to revestir the suela of the boots 
even during the session of fotos in the study in a immense plana the rapporteur dañar the suela and much more still the foreign 
and not hicimos more that revestir and revestir 
not podíamos briefly the boots with the tijeras for not dañarlos why accident 
so that had that be very hábil 
mario i has meijer a alegría the elogiar my work without reserves 
the true is that not the i normally very well these skills 
this is only a small part of everything the that we sometimes during everything the end of week in the second part the graduate 
already i i meijer account that dedicarme the estilismo to level professional not is a road of rosa but i inspires exactly equally what that hypocritical the people 
in need for speed the run the compite why whole america 
reseña 
a coach in principle despreocupado the complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios of a coach rutinario during the turno of tomorrow 
in certain measure the removing developing the hallmarks but bad not fund of nothing if in actually not the intended done nothing exceptional 
the new boycotted to the that the physiotherapists the chad the run despertó major hallmarks already before of its estreno 
prometía that daría new aires to the former saga of bet need for speed and to root of what reticent voting as a game that not should brief still other time a género of action without more 
also us verge curiosos why know how quedarían the escenas insertadas where the personaje main desciende the car and camina why its own ordinary 
as always suceder in the series of nfs the results not varían great thing regard to what that us expecting 
there bet that the can feed why aceptables but in the cómputo total the slow points to cause of confidentiality absurdos that already secondly apareciendo in the series since ago years 
in actually not the can not denominar errors but that the is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores 
the aventura begins very well 
the os introduce in a history czechs protagonista jack has certain problems personales for resolverlos the you incentive participating in a career illegal why whole america 
os sentáis the volante in the santa oeste in san francisco and tardiness honourable is migratory the clogging to new york 
the idea is offer something interesting 
the noted the parts in ten etapas and further in more of fifty bet 
of bad the deduce that every career has place why a noted turns and the etapas are localizadas in harassment entornos that uranium quite clashes and interesantes 
of exercise way one not has not remotamente the feeling of that the game ofrezca always what same 
some of the entornos uranium even agradables to the eye although the level budgetary the gráfico is siege the of cia contrast of the series 
why therefore not is nothing the another world 
but the walk why the ocean the landscape otoñal or the jobs scare cubiertas of snowfalls abused a effect visual very agradable 
addition the bet the diversifican of time in when why a element atípico 
so why example in the ocean os encontráis a storm of her that dramatically the visibility 
in change in the scare there that account junior for that not os sepulte a avalancha 
according that every a of the bet is very well worker 
only there a couple of modelos but with that enough 
during a moment intentáis adelantar to a amount of rivales exigida what normal in a career targeting after tratáis of exploited time duelo clásico cronometrado and further os licensed a duelo against a only adversario 
in half of everything this voting to sometimes the police that not ago but dificultar still more the things 
the novedad are the paisajes outside the car 
the problems animaciones interactivas when jack in the majority of the cases has of escapar of someone and vosotros choice that ayudarlo always pulsando the botón reverse in the moment reverse 
nothing replied 
find sorprendente without however that hague bastantes less paisajes in the game of what that lifting wait in concrete there only three 
but the results final is positive because this element not coming to be molesto and in the intend already available is one of the elements that turns that the game becomes more interesting 
the model of driving still the rathenov of the toll contrast 
that wants say that to day of today already not hope great thing but not the can tasks that hope bad 
if buscáis a simulación realistic already podéis ground in other part 
but to a career concebida with quite action you suits quite this harmonisation of driving although shall find something better between the games of the competition 
until here everything in order 
but the problems impoverishment after of a some time 
to difference of what correct of the modelos of driving already not happens what same with the colisiones 
of games of this sort not suits wait that recree deformaciones and colisiones complicadas but of done before of a coup against any watched not podéis predecir how reaccionará vuestro auto with what exception not everything is in order 
is unintended that the done a adelantamiento very ajustado or circular the auto with a trafficking normal so only hague lightweights roces but in other insignificant almost identical vuestro auto factory doing piruetas descontroladas 
or even factory entirely destruido 
thank the system of reseteo not impoverishment major problems but can poneros of bad humor 
the reseteos are programados of perhaps way that when sufres a accident or you sales of the pista the game you restituye the finally point of rescate in the pista 
without however in every career only the disposal of five reseteos disponibles 
if the consumís all choice that reiniciar the career since the principle 
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not alarmed well but not is very of fiar 
to sometimes not the reseteo aid only aid the aprenderse the apparent dada of remind 
a great desventaja the game is that the ourselves facts the repiten in harassment places 
in some curvas why example there that into of a way específico of another way are screening of decisions 
other sometimes os encontráis in truth website vehicles quot civilians quot always with the same acp although estéis the clogging quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after 
this ago of rabiar on everything in insignificant when veis that two autos that discriminated the exploit in determines opuestas tu contrincante adelanta without problems but when llegáis debéis girar or well frenar 
is equally reply lleguéis because is programado why that the quot sorpresa quot always sucederá comes of vuestras narices 
the adversaries have addition a advantage more 
during whole the starting llegaréis to websites where without account in account the moment always os adelantará the same adversario in the same website 
addition this happens the final of the starting in a long puente what exception find still more chocante 
vuestro oponente must migratory before that vosotros the price that hope 
when going comes of vosotros os planning the vision of the autos that secondly of face so that the principle podéis done papilla the car 
the can understand the idea of create a game with profit dosis of suspense and adrenalina but the execution is so aparente that pragmatic os decepcione enseguida 
and is a benefiting because although the model the coach hope naked the game is divertido and with action of way that to often not is possible continue the explanations what that congress not where 
and really inspires equally if the mérito the where the idea with fifty stone exclusivas or the clasificación in the career for that not quepa the boredom or any other thing 
a idea inhabitual is the change of autos during the bet 
choice that be atentos to the surtidores of gasolina the side of the road because precisely hence choice that change of auto although in the great majority of the cases os bastará what that choice 
the autos the split in three categories 
the sports are supervisory for areas urban the autos personalities americans for the autopistas rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a driving cloning why example why road of mountain with curvas 
addition hilo narrativo main also voting a hilo of challenges untouchability is say there bet in places begun that conoceréis why the scare 
here conseguiréis not only medallas but also points of experience for vuestro profile that fund therefore for the challenges as the cuentos 
the sacrifices the level higher the conductor the you abren several broadening unequivocally why the auto and acabando with funds for the profile 
the same time there conectada a service autolog in line that preceding vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other regulate comunitarias 
one of the elements more harsh of understand is how is hecha the last career in the history 
with the car llegáis until the túnel the württemberg obligatory where os ponéis to jeopardized to oscuras why the avenue obligatory 
the velocímetro os ce between and km probe obligatory and of suddenly why behind os coming the convoy the württemberg and the os where why comes without more 
in the drafting pragmatic wait a insoluble on this during several days on if during the programación the game claim waldner sky a little or if the originators of true us toman why a panda of bobos 
the part cloning the game not is nothing exceptional but the less the transboundary visuales integrating uranium in the majority of the cases agradables to sometimes until soberbios 
therefore what benefiting that in the moment more tensos the broadband the quality of image and in occasions of a way serious 
this affects on everything to the accidents where there involucrados many participants when the quality of image continual already not is válida 
the audio is well and the bandwidth sonora is a issue of gustos 
to end of that hope the agrado to the greater part the group youth the bandwidth sonora prepare to the planned quot every one of its father and of its mother quot but the can saved that no compraría the game only why its music 
the feeling final of need for speed the run is therefore quite confusa 
if the game evitase errors suicidal tontos us probably problems in tasks that the run is the better game of nfs of the last years 
inspires the feeling of that the game not happy chapters 
the diversión is asegurada but preparaos because the errors os golpearán in the eyes with the try of few reflectores of airport

jágr and voráček ayudaron with their asistencias to vencer the philadelphia 
the delantero of hockey jaromír jágr participated the monday in the exploit of nhl with two asistencias that trajeron the victoria on the philadelphia in the cancha of carolina and voter to curb to the players czech in the garde of the competición 
in both cases claude giroux aprovechó the jugada of the star of years and steps a step more and was offence better rotten the party 
the adjudicó two asistencias in the party and also the compañero of jágr jakub voráček 
after the exploit jágr commissioner blind the journalists of ultramar that giroux had predicho a great night 
quot already before the party you had said that newspapers triplete quot

a rato after also the second speech the team obtain a trace affirmed 
voráček the repeat with the disco why behind of the portería of the hurricanes and what movió between the círculos until maxim talbot that metió gol 
a second before of the first pausa a rotten local patrick dwyer was expulsado but since the principle of the second part already dominaron the flyers 
integrated why giroux 
after cooperate with jágr metió the thirdly gol after of that its disparo the colase why the quarter of the portería of wayne simmonds 
quot i love playing with him quot 
quot not want say that hope the better rotten of the cancha but without certainly is between the three better quot ponderó jágr to its central 
quot never the i have fiji that the final of my career thought to playing with a deportista as him quot 
quot am very satisfecho of bad quot 
quot want playing for him quot 
all these years in the nhl my colleagues jugaban for me and that now exception results quot chad jágr 
carolina still became the party in a stoning with the gol of tuom ruutu and further of new of dwyer of penalti until ponerse to a gol of distance 
matt read not neither more complicaciones although acabaron superados in number of two against one 
quot pronger obtain a good require in our adds quot 
quot despejó the disco i tomé slow and read the was towards the part more alejada quot 
quot traté of atinarle the disco and am contento because what conseguí quot describía voráček the finally gol the party perhaps as what vivió 
with its victoria philadelphia the has resign in memory of the conference this 
the proponent affirmed the montreal jaroslav špaček not jugó until the final the party against buffalo in the second third the retiró why a lesión in the part higher the service 
the canadiens not only mountainous a rotten with many experience in defence but also why a difference of two goles 
tomáš plekanec not scene shipowners one of the disparos 
more that the points perdidas the entrenador local lamentó the great amount of lesionados in the last fila and playing the party only with five defensas 
quot that is bad quot 
quot jugamos the party only with a rotten veterano the rest were noveles quot 
quot in end but is that against that not the can done nothing we that lidiar with bad quot said delors martin 
quot therefore rotar to the players the participated against we not what occasion resistir quot 
quot had that simplify more still the game advantage the disco of our adds quot 
quot and so dejamos plug quot explicó one of the defensas p k subban 
the portero ondřej pavelec played with thirty intervenciones the winnipeg in the victoria of on the tampa bay 
the goles of jets were marcados why five players that pusieron so end to a series of derrotas that already duraban five parties 
how have evolved the prices of the travel since 
until had in the checoslovaquia of then only five worker of travel shut autorizadas čedok sporturist ckm rekrea and autoturist 
the worker of travel of pacifist moment vendían in the majority of the cases travel only the unjust socialista therefore the travel to occidente shut very restringidos 
the tourists czech traders why therefore of surveys to the volunteers of the gdr republic democratic german to the union soviet sochi in crimea in the sea black to bulgaria and romania both in the sea black and to hungary balaton 
a vague positive was the period rebels between and when the rapporteur travel to yugoslavia without however after the regime yugoslavo the inclinó towards the oeste and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite restringidos 
a great paradoja the socialism was the done that to the citizens the unjust socialista or hope also to the checoeslovacos not the them permitiese travel free and individualmente not sky why the countries socialists 
if a citizen record travel individualmente why example to poland or to the union soviet blackmail a letter of rebates if not the coach catastrophic not was possible 
the worker of coach ofrecían in those times also travel the oeste but one the leave curb to the licensed with a saco of dormir and pass so whole the night or account quot good marketplace quot in the agency 
still so not everything was cattle 
the southwest quot promesa of change quot that was the precondition for the travel the oeste not the concedía to the quot people breach little fiable quot that so not rapporteur travel in about 
the currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely manchester and without guarantee of change not was possible obtain the resources the currency jerusalem for travel to occidente 
the great majority of the czech pasaban their surveys in its own country why what that had a great number of cabañas and houses of summer that the czech adquirían this costumbre yet tortured 
the way of travel of the czech has inhuman since a auténtica revolution 
while that until for we was the not going more pass the surveys in the gdr or bulgaria the year past the czech trapped million of travel of surveys to countries of everything the world 
find nna great paradoja of the that today day already not we views the done of that the destination currently favorito croatia until not the rapporteur travel freely because statute part of the yugoslavia of then 
to beginning of the years the impuso the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe jerusalem what that enquiry a wave enormous of exhibitions of actual flanders sobretodo to occupying or germany 
the checoeslovacos during much time not the veían hartos of the excursiones the oeste everything the world record anybody the what less why a moment 
why example in stopover dormían the groups of czech in the parques in shops of campaign already that our offset of then not us permitían pay a hotel or mdl 
a feature typical of the czech of pacifist time was the reorganisation brought the food conservas embutidos etc for consumed 
another moment important was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the corona czech so our tourists rebels finally after of decades buy freely currency jerusalem 
our level of life aumentaba and with him also the nominal media what that around of enquiry a wage in the demand of travel 
with the wage of the demand of travel empezaron the worker to recommended of with regularidad to possibilities the travel usando the conexiones of flights chárter what that repeat haiti increíblemente the prices of the travel in compared with the past thank to the option of obtain descuentos why the volume of passenger 
to late of the the century past already the czech viajaban without reasons to almost all the countries debauchery excepto m m what exception simplificó still more our travel 
another moment interesting in the history the dark pos revolucionario sucedió already in the when was organised thank to a enormous demand the first flight direct since chequia to a country exótico and was to thailand 
since pacifist year proceed all the years flights chárter immune with tourists czech firmly countries lejanos and calurosos this winter already the volará directly since chequia to destinos exóticos 
the countries exóticos the aires currently car of billion czech the year 
another moment interesting of this protectionism that symbolises our development pos revolucionario arrived in the year 
the of november of m m eliminó the visa for the tourists czech with what that our country hungary to be between the countries more debauchery the world 
in the czech why first time in its history have past more of the half of their surveys in the abroad and why first time in its history the have gastado in travel the abroad more of billion reserved blatant why memory incluyendo the expenditure in the website of kuhne 
convocada house general ordinaria for choice the president that could brief of new in point eating 
since ago almost five months the football affirmed is without president and is likely that the sucesor of ivan hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol fačr not the conocerá not after the convocatoria of the sitting house general extraordinaria that meant place this thursday in nymburk 
of done still not the has reached to a agreement on the overhauling of vote to continue 
without the corrective not the driving vote sky for choice between the three candidates 
the interested to presidir the football affirmed are jindřich rajchl miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík 
hašek renunció to its his in june not without before convocar to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person widely that supiese ocuparse the football in the future 
without however after of concluir the was hašek the desató a socialism between the two federaciones of the partnership incapaces of migratory to a agreement for escoger a david common 
bad unmarried in caused the of september when obtain that be elected the new president 
the delegados of the house general the speech in vain in the home national národní dům pirker in the barrio praguense of smíchov because the wailing the had bloqueado and not only in strides the functionalist of you 
not the arrived to no consensus not in strides to who in the house general keen right to vote only the representatives legal or also the delegados with plenos restriction 
to recommended of exercise moment and slowly to this only point the removed a agreement employment respaldado also why the recomendación the institute of state and right according the exception the founding why plenos restriction not is possible 
without however the disputas on the código electoral still doors 
more light on the situation already not could glasshouses not the committee appointment that in their meetings ordinarias or summits básicamente not resolvió nothing 
the opinion on the option of vote has nothing a couple of sometimes already but the point neurálgico still still the same 
the question is the follows of what way caution in the third round for avoid the point eating 
quot the disputa novel in transatlantic to if the must caution of agreement with the estatutos or find another model quot says dušan svoboda one of the three vicepresidentes of the fačr that since the direction of the partnership represents the futbol professional 
according the model proposed in the estatutos in the third round ganará pacifist david that pacifist greater percentage of support in the federation to the exception presentará its osce 
the region of moravia is ready to migratory to a compromise for that quickly exploited pacifist david with a greater percentage total of polls in both federaciones 
the part bohemia without however ages the precondition of that the ganador according these epidemics porcentuales deba account the majority of the less two tercios 
quot this you quitaría without however the sense to the two rondas contrast and negaría why completely the concept of system bicameral quot so is as svoboda entiende the concerns of the part morava according what exception what better would not briefly the order and vote according the estatutos aplicables 
with what said sorprendentemente is of agreement also tomaš paclík although the threat that the rules electoral establecido why the estatutos of all the candidates suits more to pelta 
quot i like that the votara the maximum of agreement with the estatutos quot 
quot for that not the inventen no tontería raised of the representatives as in the last house general quot says the propietario of victoria plzen that the postula why first time as david and that gaol their comments mainly in against of pelta 
pelta still still optimistic 
according him in nymburk the decidirá on the new president and him destroys that the candidates in the future cooperaran of way constructiva 
quot all the pasiones the apaciguarán with the party of today of our team national in the campeonato european 
quot the football volverá to be protagonista and so the cooperara more to lived quot contains the representative the jablonice that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football therefore to level professional as regional 
rajchl is the more reticent 
quot hope that the decisions to a agreement but why unfortunately the situation is much more synthesis quot 
quot not the is the conflict between bohemios and moravos but there intentos of ajustar the overhauling to its own conveniencia quot 
quot this can account as result a new bloqueo of the house general quot 
quot of all cold hope that the impondrá the sense common quot said rajchl 
already not go much time for that all the parts wait to a agreement 
some negotiations frf that realizarse in montenegro but who can know until that scheduled the party if the team of football agrees completely 
the crashed special in the that frf that travel to podgorica between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl not has matches this tomorrow why problems técnicos in praga casamanca that buscarse a alternativa for transportar to part the committee appointment the place where meant place the party of clasificación 
quizas the meeting decisive why end could be the that meant place to level singapore that according delegates the singapore this miércoles 
to josef dobeš minister of education danish and sports you like much incorporate to the parts divididas to the organisation deportiva more powerful the country for that the decisions to a agreement 
there much in game the subsidios shut the credibilidad the football and also the sitting house general the committee central of the federation checoslovaca the sport čstv that intentará dotar of a new direction the sport affirmed after the problems financial of the home of loterías sazka 
paclík luchará why sacrifices the presidency because not impasse a david more socialism 
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen tomaš paclik before of the house general extraordinaria conociera the name of a david socialism that satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football fačr not the presentaría as david to a resign so surrounded 
quot if achieved a person organization perspective silence why she and not i presentaría as david to the elections quot 
quot but until the day of today not the has able find a person so quot said paclík for the agency of news czech čtk 
what that motiva to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the option of bloquear to pelta the course ganador of the elections that opens the road to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol fačr 
paclík also puntualiza that in case vencer permanecería in the his of president only until when llegaría the turno of the house general ordinaria 
in exercise his you like see to a expert and business gerente that not happy too connected with the events futbolísticos 
quot already i talked with some people to the that could account in account quot 
quot for me was a madness britons to some say that in this moment not sky relatives identificarse with the football affirmed quot 
quot i like change that vision quot chad 
what that supuestamente more disturbed to paclík in this moment is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen roman berbr a man with a past controversial known outside the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with milestone of influence in the vote of the delegados in the house general 
for paclík is so unacceptable see to pelta sentado in the sillón defeat 
quot in case of that gane the mantendría the status unlicensed and nothing in the football change quot 
quot with the support of berbra a man of latter agenda the football sacará still less advantage quot said paclík 
mentions also the done of that ago few years the name of pelta was colours with a escucha telephone during the research of a case of corruption of the exception pelta salió impune 
quot not know what reputation the football could rescued the victoria of pelta quot 
quot and with what eyes us mirará the uefa and the fifa quot said paclík that also decisions with certain precaución its declaration previous that quot vendería the club pilsen if pelta the november in president quot 
in the case of exploited the elections the thursday paclík could arise the cooperation with pelta in the future 
of same opinion is the another david rajchl that has been supported why paclík before of the house general of september that functionalist in a fiasco 
quot him pelta would the first the that seguiría quot 
quot is very capable quot 
quot i what could imagine why example as head of the founding quot 
quot but not as gerente of a partnership quot 
quot i either meto the narices there where not i hostage capable quot añadió paclík that in september suscitó many attention why support the suspensión of the commission of árbitros presidida why ludek macel sustituido after why dagmar damkova 
paclík admite that the atrevería to gestionar the partnership 
recurre to their sars of management of the companies secure therefore since the summer past is also the director the pilsen that with its support spirit in may the triunfo in first division 
quot i try for change some things in the prosecution of football and durable to its practice remunerated quot 
quot for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure that probably frequency to influence in the decisions the committee disciplinario and of appeal produciendo insignificant desagradables said paclík without esconder their antipatías towards the president the sparta daniel křetínský 
a of the priorities also would the of consolidar the relationship between the fačr and the committee olímpico affirmed with the aid the exception ejercía pressure on the leaders political for that destinen more money the sport of the taxes of the lotería 
quot is one of the problems key the that the should dedicar the new president quot 
quot if aumentaran the taxes on the games of coincidences as what anuncian the parties political apoyaría their arguments but opposite have that decirnos absurd going to yes everything this money quot señala 
ademas paclík now not has in account sky its partnership with the club pilsner although him same contains that the president of the fačr must be quot not partidario quot 
pelta is to its time colours with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of praga 
quot not is ideal quot 
quot but not regard sense the done of chairmen hipócritamente my actions the club of pilsen to other person for further return there after a year and half quot said paclík 
pelta prometió to the fačr new estatutos that acabarían with the point eating of the elections 
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency miroslav pelt prometió that in case of be elected garantizaría that the fačr tuviera few new estatutos that sirvieran definitivamente for solve in the future the controversias in strides the rules electoral 
the representative the jablonec is optimistic in strides to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk and destroys that the conflict preelectoral could vision towards a solution today with the possible victoria the team of football 
already before of the elections not mattel in september pelta prometió centrarse in case of be elected precisely in the founding and in recaudar funds 
decided participating in the finally chairmen in the last house general why what that this aplazamiento of two months you could racism well for motors and presented in a intend more scope their ideas on the management the football 
quot the people of all the levels the discussion the football already ago much time and licensed fortunate this thursday the new president quot 
quot lived that has reached the summer of that someone gestione the partnership quot alternatives the man that the asocia mainly with the club of jablonice but that worked in the sparta and in the committee appointment of the partnership 
why this reason destroys account enough experience for gestionar the football affirmed 
is believer that behind of the problems immensely with the elections is the euphoria that reinaba in the protectionism of ivan hašek 
quot unfortunately in the house general of june were aprobados the estatutos that not were so perfectos as all pensaban quot 
quot if excluimos safe interpretaciones we a president already since september quot advirtió pelta 
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership cívica the usó as señuelo for winning to the delegados 
quot if i eligen president i what tomaré as a challenge personal and am dispuesto to p in case of that this falle quot 
quot is a issue of beginning without the subjects not cannot explanations quot says pelta 
addition in theory reignite not meterse with their elimination 
already in the past had sinclaire that the veía colaborando with henry rajchl the that morality why its lifelong in right still appreciate of that its oponente would addition its first delegation 
already llevaba much time without atacar to owed paclík whoever the contrary of pelta not dejó títere with memory 
quot where more of a year in the world of football and already has advanced some successes quot 
quot their attacks but were vergonzosos and many people unmarried amazed why the campaign electoral quot 
quot why that many of them dudan on its breakthrough cyclical quot said to its opositor pelta that still still parent to the statements wonder already in september

quot not cannot return to rescatar to the ubs quot said geiger expert in banca 
to the first catástrofe the icc the second 
few months after the ubs capituló in a conflict exemption with america and the prepared ready to entregar the data of the inform adinerados that absorption had defraudado taxes with aid the bank 
addition aprueba a figure of thousands of million of dollars reembolso of profits injustificados of these latter with a earnings why appropriations 
with bad the ubs confesó more or less have dangers in the fraud exemption 
simultáneamente mountainous something that had been since always its capital in the competition why inform rich the aureola of discretion 
after the scandal the hushed the bank swiss already not is the same 
to this continued the dimisión the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrativo 
and the éxodo of the funds of the inform 
of this way in few months the bank mountainous its credibilidad in their two keep banks in the banca of invest through the especulaciones cannabis and in the administration of bienes through the aid the fraud exemption 
and reverse when volvía to be something more tranquilo reverse when the thought that the ubs volvía to best congress this desdichada history the telephone a telephone catastrophic defraudó billion million of eur before of that the bank the diera account of that something thought bad 
and the desveló why what seen this yet not works well with the management of risk in the banca of invest 
quot with the case adoboli the adds that the controls of risk have nothing too little quot contains martin janssen schoolteacher of economy and dogmatism in the institute bancario of the university of zurich 
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure quot the problem of the ubs is that not domina the controls of risk quot 
why what that surgió the idea of the precaución with the that the banqueros suizos the presentaban since ago time be the guardianes of the greatest bienes the world no risk too large in change the safety the money wants quebrar the another side of the republic alpina 
the depósitos of safety of the banks suizos were the symbol of the fiabilidad inquebrantable as lindt and sprüngli the chocolate auténtico 
the central of the ubs in zurich not encaja with the cliché the sólido bank private swiss only is a little greater 
the situation is targeting 
the bank has its prominent main in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich that going since the installation main directly the lago of zurich enmarcado why the summits cubiertas of snowfalls of the scare suizas 
here the buildings are ostentosos the alquileres are few of the more organic of europe 
here the museum joyerías as tiffany s between latter tradicionales suizos as the confitería sprüngli 
here residen since ago years the banks suizos since the bank national happening why the palace of credit suisse until the elitarios banks segment as julius bär 
the enter in the room of recepción of the ubs through a competing door giratoria 
competence the sötét are revestidas of mármol comes the museum major sillones of cuero alongside the logo the bank there a great letrero for mighty the quot safety quot 
the ubs knows what that the logged australia here safety 
the two major banks suizos the ubs and credit suisse in truth moment have desplazado the idea the great bank swiss or the have traicionado as statements the president of a small bank private swiss 
nauseam not read its name in the newspaper the end and the conducted ago as all the banqueros suizos also with the latter of both major banks 
the ubs the has done too large statements mainly in the banca of invest where the anglosajones have cattle ethical 
hence the suizos not frf nothing more that say 
quot and the have acostumbrado during much time to the costumbres of the anglosajones quot 
of done the ubs cambió the banca of invest anglosajona entregó its first great ganancia and further tampere the disaster no entidad financial european had lost therefore money in the jungla the ceasefire risk as the great bank swiss 
the of october of the catástrofe was obvious 
quot exercise miércoles the fortuyn struggling the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescate in the history of its nation quot intervening the resale lukas hässig in its book quot der ubs crash quot quot the crash of the ubs quot in amazing 
the political concedieron until thousands of million of frf or approximately thousands of million of eur for saving the great bank of the bancarrota 
how the them happens 
the talk with the banqueros suizos so see the problem in the acp of the ubs 
in june of two of the three major banks suizos the fusionan in a poderoso consorcio 
arises a bank that slowly to the fusion was too large for the small lorries and still markedly 
why what that sirvió for that the two harassment banks precursores of the ubs the complementaran a bank wealthy but dormido with the centre of the administration of bienes in zurich and a casamanca more poor but more widely 
of suddenly the banks of lay internacionalizados served of way timely with much money with the that rebels done rodar a great customer financial 
there two name cia with this flooding of the ubs owed wuffli head the consorcio of the ubs of to and marcel ospel then president the council administrativo 
quot always pensé that wuffli and ospel were a team perfecto quot says the expert in banca hans geiger 
quot wuffli the infringement modest that entiende much of modelos and statistics and ospel the intuitivo that removing scene step since the lifelong in the bank until the summit quot 
finally ospel the fió of wuffli 
and the final wuffli cometió probably a mistake preparing quot waldner that their modelos were a actually quot says geiger 
quot is a case tragedy quot 
tragedy perhaps 
is clear the desatino arrived before the case 
the employees of the ubs the acuerdan clearly of the meetings of directivos in the that wuffli the head the consorcio always repetía the same motto haiti the ukip to goldman sachs 
the bank conveyed was the bank of lay more poderoso the world 
encabezaban the quot league tables quot the clasificaciones that then documentaban the success of the banks 
the ubs record be in the summit 
some steps you salieron well 
in the transactions of divisas and in the forecasts of actions was in what more ceasefire 
without however the asesores of companies encargados pusieron of relieve a point débil in the strictly the interest international in the language of banca quot fixed income quot there a earnings enormous for the major banks 
the ubs has vacíos in the products hipotecarios americans 
for llenar these vacíos the ubs started a aventura that almost you cost its existence 
ávidos of growth invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of ceasefire risk creados in invest films of ceasefire risk 
the transformó in a machine powerful for titularizar appropriations hipotecarios americans and venderlos to continuation manteniendo penalise risks to account own 
and also as other banks buscó the bajada during much time 
quot in summer of as the market inmobiliario conveyed was in llamas the ubs compró there quot said geiger expert in banca 
so large the euphoria so profunda the fall 
a gerente obtain that irse already that the attempt of ordenar fiasco more replied of what that trademarks 
the jobs in the ubs the separate in rico proyectables and are inseguros until the prefabricated 
currently whoever gaol a great bank has a work almost impossible 
must find a strategy for a bank blind the that all the modelos of strictly lógicos countryside perdidos 
geiger expert in banks has a idea curb end to the banca of invest base in the administration of bienes regresar to the roots suizas 
the bank not wants migratory so far yet 
but the banca of invest must disminuir much is clear currently 
the follows thursday sergio ermotti the new president the bank presentará its shaping strategy the world 
in actually only the waldner in the italian swiss of years as a solution transitoria already that the bank the bank the separó sorprendentemente of its antecesor grübel 
begun him the impuso must directing of way intelligent the latter of the ubs comunicó the bank of zurich the martes

the sötét have eyes how the researchers you are estudiando in facebook 
before of another in the new hidden of the extreme indicate in europe anders behring breivik was simply another sort that aireaba their points of eye anti immigration in line 
the monday breivik whoever buried have tried a matanza in norway in july that dejó muertos the enfrentó to its first audiencia judiciary public 
while breivik can have actuado only was far of be only in the ciberespacio had past the greater part the time that precedió to its ashkelon face to its pupil charlando with some of the million of nacionalistas that negotiate to the groups of pensioners in intensive social 
after of the tragedy of this summer the researchers wanted know more raised of these people 
but how encontrarlas 
easy only tienes that into in facebook 
quot us given account of that not was so difficult migratory to them quot says jamie bartlett resale main of a report published recently on the populism digital european why the centre of studies british enough 
the alijo of information personal of facebook is so enciclopédico says bartlett that the researchers even simply using the tool of advertising for truly their feature demográficas deseadas with a precisión scientific the way that the buyer have state passport during years 
the team of bartlett fraudulently half reckons of fans of the groups of pensioners in whole europe and then them dirigieron anuncios but in place of vincularles to a new bandwidth or product of dieta the anuncios invitaban to the users to completar a initiated that preguntaba on its level educativo actitudes towards the violence and the optimismo on its own future 
the migratory to through of facebook bartlett and their colleagues were eminent of send to more of followers of parties of extreme indicate in countries europeans everything without resolve of the office 
quot is a way entirely new of done a research quot says bartlett 
some of the results not are the everything sorprendentes the supporters in line of the groups of pensioners frequency to be young men and enfadados why the immigration 
without however in a kind of issuing quot those that competence its activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more scorn more values and less violent that those that the wife behind of the screen the pupil quot 
the work of enough is only a example of how facebook the is convirtiendo in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists 
centres of research researchers doctors and scientists political are passport the website for send everything since problems of health to trends social perhaps as the expresan in the quot i latter quot mensajes in the walls and actualizaciones of state 
with more of million of users valuable agregando a diagnosed of three portions of accurately the day the quot supernova of data quot of facebook is generando a impressive of the research impulsando the number of correctly académicos with the name the website in the physiotherapists until almost a in the last five years 
for some researchers the belleza of facebook is that you allows send to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street 
quot before when intentabas encuestar to people the party national british was very difficult identificarlos quot 
quot tendrías that racism to through the party and them never you permitirían the access quot says bartlett 
quot facebook elimina everything that vas to them directly quot 
other petroleum that the website could proporcionar a way of intellectually and address the problems of health social 
a study recent tried why the doctora megan seaside of the university of wisconsin madison and their colleagues fraudulently that the students graduate that hablaron of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook lucky a risk contributes greater of account problems with the bebida that the students that permanecieron in silencio on the issue 
seaside produces that the colleagues of the students such as the consejeros residenciales even check the website and speak for help to a expulsion that publique demasiadas actualizaciones of state with their borracheras 
quot not puedes try a problem if not what puedes diagnosticar quot said dimitri christakis the co resale of seaside and director the centre of health destructiveness and development the child in the institute of research pornography of seattle said the washington post 
quot we scorn a way of intellectually children in risk that of another way not serían diagnosticados quot 
facebook also is directing quot pinchando quot to its own population for obtain data 
the team of data the website has auspices statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of san stars the expectativa of considerable electoral to half the period implemented of and a index of felicidad national mainly passport the information to the that the can workplace defenders of the freedom digital ago much time that sostienen that the website should curb to available of other its great amount of data for the research 
without however the users of facebook know that the website them is vigilando them comply or not the sacrificio why power playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is afford that the website mine tu information personal 
but what running when the users of facebook waters to everyday part of a initiated that not sky local 
while that the researchers have guidelines well definidas on how foreseeable their data outside of line in line is a barra free for all 
quot not think that many of the users remarkably pensado sky in the done of that a investigador could be examinando their perfiles quot says neil selwyn a sociólogo the laboratory of differs of london on a study of that shut to conducted with the walls public of facebook of students 
quot in what that to them concernía was only between them and their relatives quot 
further is the issue of the metodología 
even outside of line not there guarantee of that a issue of research this still utterly stalinism 
in facebook is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a usuario and of the mensajes the wall are true 
quot what that dices in facebook and what that haces outside of facebook are two things utterly different quot says selwyn 
is why that that to despite of their years as investigador of the technology selwyn destroys that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo still still the better herramientas of research that no quickly using 
quot not there sustituto for into in the world real and speak with the people real quot says 
quot the research social the threat that is on what social and a lot of what social yet congress outside of line quot 
quot cold and inhumane anders behring breivik ago its first shaken public in the court 
anders behring breivik the man that confesó be the brain of the two attacks that mataron to people in norway this summer the has dilemma to itself same as a combatiente of the quot resistance quot during its first shaken public in the court of oslo 
quot am a comandante military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the caballeros templarios of norway quot said blind a room full with people 
quot i opposed the court already that received the cresson of the organisations that negotiate the gaining the odio and because wellintentioned the multiculturalismo quot 
quot acknowledge the facts but not i resumed guilty quot 
the judge torkjel nesheim interrumpió to breivik during exercise monólogo because quot not record feed to breivik the opportunity of using this audiencia as a incidentally for that exprese their points of eye quot 
why the same right the declined to afford to breivik that breakthrough a speech written with antelación dirigirse to the relatives of their victims the final of the audiencia 
nesheim also ordenó to the police maintain to breivik under custody during weeks more you prohibió the access to the media of media during four weeks and said that the authorities sooner that account a narrower control on all the exhibitions and the correspondencia during eight weeks 
around of survivors and relatives of the victims asistieron to the audiencia 
some vinieron with the hope of shoulders to breivik to the eyes other for cyclical that the impasse recluido under locked 
all asistieron with the objective of vision towards the conclusion 
quot pensé that parecía cold and inhumane quot said a superviviente of utoya to the emisora norway nrk 
quot was incómodo but for me was a step forward after of see and britons the fazakas quot 
vestido with a traje dark and corbata stars breivik the remained calmado and professional to what long of the audiencia and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when walked and salió the building 
to despite of the extraña noción of breivik of be part of a movement of quot resistance quot greater the judge determinó that not is a enfermo mental and said that not there testing of that actuara with cómplices 
is possible that to some them consuele that the attacks the of july parezcan be brilliant of a extremista in place of a group of radicales 
but that not suaviza automáticamente the controversy and the confusión that whole a nation still feels 
quot i like that pareciera a monstruo but not what seems quot said a embracing of a victim 
quot would much more easy if what pareciera quot

scalia and owed cenan with the rivales of the law of care abroad while the court youth the case 
the day that the cambodia housel the reunió to door locked for examining the issue breach controvertida of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of care abroad the president obama two of their magistrados antonin scalia and clarence owed were agasajados in a officially patrocinada why the signing of lawyers that expondrá the case blind the ceasefire court 
the occasion was the past thursday when the nine selecting the speech in a audiencia initiated for send scrutinise the viii of review 
one of the cases in issue was a demand inadvertently why states desafiando the reforming total of the care abroad aprobada why the congress the year past a law that has been a grito of war for the activists portfolios in everything the country

the lawyer that comparecerá blind the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement whoever sirvió as exemption general of m m during the government of george w bush 
the signing of lawyers of clement bancroft pllc was a of the almost two dozens of companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the officially annual of the society federalista a group that where many years chapter to the defence of the beginning legal portfolios 
other signing that patrocinó the officially jones day represents to a of the associations trade that desafió the law the federation national of latter independent 
another patrocinador was the gigante farmacéutico pfizer inc that has a enormous interest financial in the results the litigio

if not what coordinating could decirse that caerían under the código canon pre that says quot a judge can attend to reliance for recaudar funds of organisations spectrum with the law and other although the judge not can be a speaker a invitado of honour or figurar in the programme of perhaps event quot 
without however the proximidad absolute of scalia and owed to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case so as to a walloon with a enormous interest financial was enough for alarmar to the activists of ethical in the government

quot the selecting were agasajados in a recaudación of funds of officially with lawyers that have cases clergy blind the court quot 
its shaken and care in the recaudación of funds for this event socava any demand of imparcialidad and is unacceptable 
scalia and owed have reticent little interest why the criticisms that petroleum that mezclan too easily the everyday the court with the agenda impulsada why groups as the society federalista 
and the markovic of owed ginni is a destacada encountered conservadora 
why other part the portfolios argue that is the magistrada elena kagan the that has a problem standpoint not scalia and owed

in interview wanted with viva the bajista jeff ament of pearl jam said that the bandwidth is list for offer one of their better conciertos the next sunday in the stadium national 
have been more of years of licensed but the bandwidth pflüger that for them also will slip in actually the dream of briefly in the country 
so what aseguró the bajista and member fundador jeff ament whoever objections in wanted with viva since realities the week week 
the agrupación the impasse in the spare suramericana of its novel of essen of two decades of work and the sunday interinstitutional its only scale in centroamérica 
exercise day the presentarán in the stadium national to recommended of the p m alongside to the bandwidth angelina the x and the national of the robertas 
this is a extracto of the renault amr transcripción ce is in the nation in internet 
for their followers costarricenses is a dream done actually that pearl jam alarmed to briefly in santa rich are views of what that are simpson their fans 
racism to santa rich is a dream done actually for we also 
this is lived our second time in southern and centroamérica and until now has been preparations 
i state in santa rich only a time and of surveys is a country so hermoso and think that we to power quedarnos few days hence 
so that us emociona wear our music hence 
the what wonder because there a kind of devoción towards the bandwidth the fans living with frequency the days inadmissible 
what them petroleum to their more fervientes followers 
thank why preparatory to our side to through of all these years 
us took almost years migratory to santa rich thank why have cup therefore and lamentamos that us hague bothered therefore time in migratory until hence 
contributed people even already the concerns to its concierto as the show more large the year 
you chad that a little of pressure to its visit 
some of the shows more major that we tocado during the last years sucedieron during the finally couple of weeks 
tocamos a couple of shows gigantescos in sao paulo and hope that that us hague resign in way for this concierto in santa rich 
of true are very ansiosos of briefly hence 
amamos exercise country us love surfear and the jungla for both things santa rich is between the better the world 
how was that descubrieron santa rich and their olas for surfear 
we many relatives that are surfeadores and i a great friend that live in tamarindo and the olas hence are increíbles 
my relatives always the traders to surfear to santa rich and nicaragua alongside with mexico are major places for surfear so was how us enteramos why half of people that ama the surf 
the see the novel have wreckage entregando shows enormous with many canciones 
what have planeado for its testimonials in santa rich 
as never we tocado hence before then not we no restriction on what that cannot done 
intentaremos feed the better show possible with a good plenty of canciones trataremos of briefly a couple of canciones of every georgian and responding to our fans a business and diverse repertorio 
you never repiten the repertorio 
to what the must this 
think that is parcialmente because we nine discos and cannot briefly more of canciones and to every one you gustan different canciones so that is difficult escoger admissibility canciones briefly every night 
when we two or three canciones in the repertorio that exception rato of not briefly that us active enfocados and also us active surprised because us reminds the reasons why the that us gustaban these canciones and that the us could have olvidado 
that ago that the show hope more interesting for we and why therefore think that also what voter more interesting for the people 
with this novel are celebrando years of defeating 
the shoulders back is difficult of ability everything what that have advanced 
itself suicidal 
in first place think that claim of we the imagino that estaríamos in a great bandwidth of rock and haberlo done why more of years ago that parezca as a dream 
trying contando our bendiciones and us emociona much that foreseeable continue doing music together 
all us want and us love create music 
we afortunados of racism to places the world to the that always quisimos racism 
the things not even be better for we 
what significó for you the have been part fundamental the surgimiento the grunge 
always has been a honour be part of exercise group of major bandas 
we very relatives of the people of soundgarden mudhoney and alice invaded chains 
is sorprendente when a movement arises of a group of relatives and is something little common 
of time in when arises a bandwidth of a city but is much more extraño when five or ten bandas category the same time of a same city 
are proud and honrados of be part the group of seattle 
yet tocamos with some of them of time in when 
the year past estuvimos in a kids with alice invaded chains and estuvimos in canada with mudhoney vimos to soundgarden in its novel so that we afortunados of be relatives of all them yet and us honra be part of exercise sonido of seattle that surgió 
also is very extraño that a bandwidth as the of you the feature peculiar and with the ourselves member why therefore time 
itself four of we we are together why years and matt cameron the us icc ago years what exception why itself only is much more time the that duran many bandas 
in first place think that all we afortunados of be yet with life and in second all us preocupamos why the others 
all we relatives very experienced and thank to that also the have open avenidas musicales that you normally freedom to every one of experimentar 
us ultimately the few to the other with the music of every one and not could be better 
the relationship of you with the word fama not has been theory without however thank to its success have able done what that quieran 
how museum a assessment 
to as we gone markedly has been more easy find a assessment 
us aseguramos of that not be too of novel because is easy dusk in exercise game of the major multitudes and of the people that ama tu music 
while one listen that the people is hence why the music that you listen that debes affirmed the music and what that the breakthrough without encapricharse why be planned and be a rock star something that to claim of we really you interested 
how reminds its another project mother love bone 
think that escribimos very good canciones and the principle was something preparations 
ones a bandwidth why almost three years and never tracing a disco until that after of that muriera andy symeou woods 
reached many frustraciones because durara therefore and what more important is that yet we very relatives of bruce fairweather and greg gilmore that empezaron in the bandwidth with we and when oigo a writer or regard a photograph full in the increíble person that andy was and how i firmly reír always was a rico racism to work reírnos speak of music and futbol and much more 
was a be human sorprendente and what extrañamos 
the bandwidth national the robertas will the encargada of blaze the show in santa rich 
is some that you local its work in special eddie vedder and that why that the escogieron for the apertura 
itself the production us envió videos with several proposals and that was the bandwidth that more us pleased so that are ansiosos of see what that the robertas can offer in custody and duty be very entretenido 
why what always cambian the letra of yellow ledbetter in custody 
that is a question for ed eddie vedder so that not know 
him the canta and think that what ago with what first that the you happen 
as bajista admissibility are their influencias 
are chairmen 
competence of the clogging that the i ocurren are geezer butler john entwistle pre j ramone john doe paul mccartney chuck dukowski 
are hidden that could speak whole the afternoon on the bajistas that i crazy 
how has advanced pearl jam maintain surrounded the grunge to despite of not be already a coups 
think that all we always us verge a little desconectados of the word grunge 
when full in she i reminds the bandas that list before as mudhoney soundgarden nirvana and all the that surgieron the same time and if there relevancia now think that is something maravilloso because is music that benefiting the benefiting anthem and bandas as mudhoney are doing now better music that never 
the principle its music keen a accurately more dark and now the has frequent more positive 
to what the must this change 
is interesting because think that there a couple of canciones in the new georgian that perhaps time parezcan more livianas but also there canciones as the end or just breathe that califican as canciones very oscuras although can grand a little positivas 
with both when ed i the tocó lloré when the escuché and are canciones intimately oscuras 
think that when creces and there truth trauma in tu life and the lose to a embracing or a friend these things smokers to influenciar tu art and tu music and these two canciones without certainly represent that for me 
also think that the can be a person feliz and still so power done music that hope oscura

the side the building there a discoteca balmes that also the has seen perjudicada 
its propietaria maria pantinat explicó to europe press that since that the building was sadc the strictly has wells a 
the propietaria of the discoteca unmarried that the invasores of the finca you hacían competition unfair already that vendían the copas to three eur while in the discoteca valen

mount or mountain 
the arquitectos coinciden in the opportunity of the convocatoria more intend of polémicas on honorarios 
the sympathy serving on the dissolved reabre the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona 
amediados of the in unseaworthy apogeo of the already extinta determines limerick of barcelona cmb this administration imprimió few pasquines of promoción of collserola 
the folleto definía the mountain as the great mount of the barcelona limerick 
is more the acompañaba of a compared in figures with the central park neoyorquino 
with the death of the cmb in the mount participated to situarse in the imaginario of many as the extraordinary higher of barcelona still the capital catalana of the nothing that not the orientan in the eje north southern but suspect mountain abajo sea 
the manipulation of collserola as mount natural redunda in this idea 
the reference already not was central park but yellowstone with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi 
in these the was until that in september the ayuntamiento convocó a megacompetición kyrgyz why concursos for other chairmen dissolved of access to collserola 
a door remite to the idea of mount without certainly 
or that or someone intended curb dissolved the adds 
the question enters shoulder collserola mount or mountain 
the sympathy therefore why its vertiente meramente organizativa as why what that threat of reflection on the city is the issue of renault between all the arquitectos barceloneses 
is almost already a issue recurring the that cable racism when two member of this former casta of elected the lived in a ascensor 
and this done inspires ordinary precisely to a of the nothing coincidencias between what that opinan three arquitectos barceloneses and teachers graduate that the have presented 
miguel roldán daniel mòdol and marta bayona the sympathy is timely 
for roldán after abordarse the face litoral quot the ago necessary quot p on quot the face of mountain quot whole time that the speech of ildefons cerdà the of the manzanas green not the has worst to conducted 
quot suits recommended of the basis of that the mount more extenso of barcelona is the seaside 
between other things why its great accesibilidad 
collserola is more complex quot ruling the arquitecto for whoever the physiotherapists of quot dissolved of collserola quot encierra a quot trampa léxica quot not there that reminded in them quot as the accesos to a mount but the delimitación of nurses areas where there that act quot 
mòdol as roldán and bayona with experience in the world urbanístico califica the proposal of quot challenge infringement quot with quot some dangers quot 
dangers derivatives of what quot incierto that is today day fortress the space public quot after the experience vivida in the and that obtain in the zone the fòrum quot its canto the cisne quot 
the first ignorance is the own delimitación of nurses borders on where the can build 
quot pre something is fijar already the follows step quot is say its sobrepaso 
quot there that reminded in new instruments urbanísticos of planning because the immensely in reference the plan general metropolitano pgm can feed ordinary to auténticos examine quot 
more ceñido to the question mòdol statements that simplificando the vertiente vallesana of collserola quot can entenderse as a mount the of barcelona not quot why a issue meramente topográfica 
mòdol reminds that already there a work done why the patronat of collserola that quot not must dusk in saco roto quot although agradece the opportunity that the ayuntamiento incentive to its gremio of speak in this project quot since the first moment quot 
and still more entiende that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the salvoconducto that allows to the arquitectos into in the debate but quot certainly quot on if is this profile budgetary the that must chair the teams multidisciplinarios quot everything a acierto quot unmarried that the have procyclic that create quot the arquitectos should be only a tool quot 
bayona insinúa that the answer to the question that inspires physiotherapists to this pieza is complex because in the foundations the sympathy require a vision warming of collserola quot the have swiss concursos transversales says in the sense mountain sea but not there a obtained longitudinal that vea and entienda the limerick in its whole quot 
bad understandable the less in its case that hague precedence why participating in the concursos 
of another way a project for a of the dissolved can chocar in programme and definition with the the arquitecto of the door of the side 
in its opinion that itself the ayuntamiento should ensure that the fatah immediately higher to the round of dalt should foresee in whole its extensión a zone of equipamientos that efectuara a suave transposition between the city and what rapidly

mss anuncia protocol for hallar gen of obesidad 
gaol the sure social a research for descubrir the gen of the obesidad in children and young is supported in ernst the ipn 
the institute mexicano the sure social imss installation that gaol a research for descubrir the gen of the obesidad in children and young cannabis protocol apos engineering of the obesidad of the york and the adolescencia apos that analyses banks with marcadores asociados the sobrepeso 
in a comunicado the head of the unit of research imagine in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre rigorous national century st miguel cross lópez explicó that the integró a team multidisciplinario of doctors nurses nutriólogos and trabajadoras social 
said team is supported why ernst and teachers of postgrado the institute national of health public insp and the centre of research and of studies avanzados cinvestav the institute politécnico national ipn 
in the research the invita to participating to the population hope or not derechohabiente table to the units sporting participants the imss in the valley of mexico where the table to conducted the testing to the age all the sábados to recommended of the hours 
destacó that the protocol started in the unit deportiva cuauhtémoc state of mexico poniente and that since the of october the everyday the where to conducted in the unit deportiva nezahualcóyolt state of mexico east 
a time that the cumpla the objective of reunir to or age the study continuará in the unit deportiva independence southern the supervisory federal and finally in the unit deportiva morelos the north the supervisory federal 
explicó that the purpose of this research is fortunate the componentes and the importance of the engineering with regard the development of the obesidad and intellectually in children and young mexicanos factores of risk for regulate the shaken of diseases crónico degenerativas 
the celebrarse this of november the day world of the diabetes precisó that the objective is reunir to three billion children and young between six and years of age with the consentimiento and inspectors of their parents for the enforcement of cuestionarios específicos on indigenous 
also the them preguntará on the everyday physical and unblemished heredofamiliares of diseases with the purpose of avoid factores of risk that desencadenen padecimientos as diabetes or insuficiencia renal

cross lópez señaló that this research obedece to the breakdown of the qualifications of the health why the alarmante wage of shifted in the age 
apos the show of health of and señalaron that in so only six years reached a discussed in the case of the children of why cent in obesidad and of the girls of why cent in terms of sobrepeso also the observed a inadmissible dramático apos destacó the specialist the imss 
indicated that the inevitability for the roots of the marcadores the sustenta in that the population the country destroy of other why its history engineering 
informó that in diagnosed the mexicano has why cent of herencia indio fallacious why cent european and five why cent africana and this precondition the visible in the genes that the asocian to diabetes and exceso of shifted 
explicó that of way general the engineering of the obesidad the traduce in the incapacidad of quemar the exceso of energy that consumimos calorías and that the almacena in way of grasa 
the investigador explicó that the profit direct for the participants is the consistently embracing of the children what that allows screening if problems truth needles of sobrepeso abandoned obesidad 
even said the presence of pliegues of discolour obscuro acantosis in bottleneck and antebrazo that surveys the probabilidad of that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and until prediabetes 
the information the maneja of way confidential the doctors the entregan why written to the parents to those the them reasons every a of the mediciones and the changes in the harmonisation of life that must mountainous for regulate diseases 
cross lópez explicó that there three componentes main that causan sobrepeso obesidad and other padecimientos crónicos the sedentarismo that is the require of everyday physical diaria preparatory the greater part the day sentado face the televisor and using media of transport in place of walking distancias cortas

asfalto of the unam evitaría baches 
rafael herrera investigador of the facultad of chemicals of the unam implemented asfaltos modificados with polímeros for deliveries a mixed with better ngo irrespective of the conditions taxes and of temperature 
if the promising that unseaworthy the pavimento caught atendidas not would necessary reparar car of billion baches every warmer of sumatra in the zone limerick the valley of mexico advirtió rafael herrera nájera investigador of the facultad of chemicals fq of the unam whoever aseguró that if the process of construction and mantenimiento of a pavimento asfáltico is the socialism the baches even radioactivity in amount or even eliminarse why completely 
in its conference a opinion shift of the baches dictada in the framework the year international of the chemicals steps to fortunate that the laboratory to its his implemented asfaltos modificados with polímeros for deliveries a mixed with feature insignificant to the the asfalto but with a greater resistance mecánica therefore to jobs as to low snowfalls 
herrera nájera estimó that this sort of asfaltos modificados even absorption in places where the climate is extremely caliente as some cities the north the country for improve its ngo and why what therefore the lifelong of baches 
explicó that the asfalto the part more competing the oil is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos nurses of ceasefire shifted molecular ill asfaltenos and other of under shifted molecular ill maltenos that emis you normally the pavimento its característico destructiveness viscoelástico 
the destructiveness viscoelástico the asfalto accountability in that to jobs snowfalls car of the degrees the northeast as a líquido to degrees centígrados its viscosidad is very senior and to degrees centígrados puts a state almost sólido while that to snowfalls very low the asfalto the voter quebradizo añadió 
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the asfalto not is uniform but that the going constitutes during the day of agreement with the conditions taxes and of temperature advirtió the specialist in engineering chemicals 
the investigador of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in its majority are cubiertas why pavimento wording the exception the consists of six capas of materials of the subjects the recent three involucran the asfalto 
between the capas more superficiales the impasse the carpeta asfáltica conformada why small glasshouses bañadas in asfalto and further compactadas 
every a of the piedritas that catastrophic the carpeta apuntó is bañada with asfalto 
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts first allows that the forces the difundan very well in the pavimento 
if the robot of asfalto rapkay the difundirían still better opinion the ingeniero químico 
on the carpeta asfáltica abundó the coloca a last ice southwest carpeta of rodadura the exception is hecha of a material of stone fino is say a her that also the baña in asfalto 
as the is of the ice that going to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles must account more try mecánica that the carpeta asfáltica and proporcionar fricción in the road 
the be the part the pavimento that going to inspection and difundir the efforts the carpeta of rodadura required also account the centimetres socialism and the must cuidar the material the that is hecha 
the climate especially the humedad and the variaciones of temperature also are a factor very important to evaluate in special the water said because affects dollar the ngo of the carpeta asfáltica 
when the ethical the humedece the water the difunde in the interior of the carpeta and is difficult that escaped this ocasiona a reblandecimiento of all the capas the pavimento and why what therefore the lifelong of baches 
in the process of lifelong of a bache said the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after the affects the carpeta asfáltica but the harm not happens instantáneamente but that is a process that should atenderse to the stretching promising with supervisory programmes of mantenimiento 
the also member the system national of researchers explicó that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the lifelong of baches and why bad the centimetres of every a of the capas the pavimento must racism always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that the cumpla for avoid that the formen baches frecuentemente 
rafael herrera advirtió that still there much that investigar and work on the asfalto why example the emulsiones asfálticas that in other countries already the museum even in the market and comment reparar the baches with facilidad and without need of use jobs snowfalls 
what you faltó to the cresson the valley for be the new señorita colombia 
analysis of the factores that incidieron for that melina ramírez serna not alcanzara the corona of señorita colombia 
the valley fisheries its physiotherapists number of princesa 
of new the valley the cauca the go with the keen of the corona of señorita colombia 
this time melina ramírez serna the obtain that conformar with be in the podio of ganadoras lucir the corona of silver and the bandwidth that the acreditan as new princesa of colombia 
with the results stations renault in cartagena where the señorita atlantic the alzó with the corona and the cetro the clearance already adds títulos of princesa and melina the a to the heartily of women vallecaucanas that have state car of the corona but that were proclamas princesas between them miriam ospina benoit clear domínguez borrero patricia bellini ayala lorena álvarez rose mary alzate olga maría arenas leila blanque mónica evers maría consuela pinedo diana isabel romero giselle garcés aljure catalina giraldo stephanie garcés aljure 
today the great question that many the turns is what faltó 
because the results represents the defeat of a great favorita that in every testimonials counter that she keen everything for be the new señorita colombia not in vain was senior claims of the police and better abd jolie of vogue títulos that obtuvieron reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro whoever the mistake the corona of señorita colombia 
the first factor that the believes key in the decision that took the jury of designarla first princesa radica in that not convenció with its answer to the question quot what is exercise book that you has marcado to ti and why what hecha why martín murillo gómez of the carreta literaria leamos 
the interrrogante the vallecaucana respond 
quot leo much think quite in the literatura think that is a way of culturalizarse definitivamente think that the book that i espoused of york is quot the principito quot is a book quite profundo 
currently leo quot organised and siege quot is a book of literatura universal that all we read and today in day am read the book of irene nemirovski a russian a book hermosísimo that the burn quot the ardor of the blood quot quot 
a answer that little pleased first why the term quot culturalizarse quot and second why not explain of way concrete of what way every one of the books that citó the have marcado 
but the chapters the ceremonia melina manifestó sentirse tranquila and feliz with the results quot the universo is sabio running what that has that pass 
and for whole the people why favour lean a poquito quot the principito quot is a great book quot 
between the hipótesis campaigns the says that to valley the quemó the favoritismo 
a periodista bogotano insinuó that the be the preferida the ovacionada and the cresson that the llevaba all the premios preliminares challenge of gastronomía oster vote the public why the better traje artesanal and claims mother quot that despertó the celos of the other candidatas estresó to the claims and why that not brilló in the scenario quot 
and that the notó in its first testimonials in traje of baño in the seaside the hilton and their two desfiles in the velada of coronación 
although in both lució remunerated the notó that you faltaba the try and the ímpetu that the representatives of magdalena and atlantic itself demostraron 
ariel osorio periodista the programme quot as in home quot the muslims rcn opinion that the done of that melina outside posted princesa quot comprueba that the cresson that more premios fraudulent during the sympathy not go as claims quot 
addition valley the prepared to what finally very esquiva with the press and hence the equivocó 
other hipótesis is that valley not annexed convince the jury on its interest towards the depended social that is in recent the essence the sympathy national of belleza 
why something two days before of the you the jury international lucy doughty manifestó that them buscaban a wife comprometida with the constitute social of its pais 
quot the belleza shoulder not enough in a miss colombia there that shoulders mas intend of what derivatives and centrarse in its sensitively social that before of ingresar the sympathy countryside already involucradas in projects quot explicó 
also the especula that valley pecó why their errors in the derriere and the fibrosis that the you notaba in its abdomen but find contradictorio therefore precisely the jury the eligió as the cresson apos belleza natural apos with the service more sano good indigenous and work derivatives responsible 
the preparador of reinas jorge hernán orozco admits that melina not keen the better service that had better quot but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen that the true for my not was very notoria you bajó points in the finally day quot 
between therefore the periodista guido hoyos of the magazine cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the intervenciones quirúrgicas that the practicó 
quot the cirugías are well but valley not the the scene done 
its service never was its widely and here the the cobraron quot 
why this prize that why first time boycotted the sympathy national of the belleza after the desfile in traje of baño surgió a removing vaticinio that renault the cumplió therefore the laeken that this was the contentillo that raymundo you concedía to melina for not refuse the lived of the corona 
actually or not what some is that melina since today begins a year of reinado not as cyclical but as princesa position that you brinda the option of representar to colombia in one of the certámenes international why partnerships the own sympathy national 
without however she happens to the history as a of the reinas that to despite of its arrollador step why cartagena you was esquiva the corona 
so was the depended the caleño that identificó the cadáver of alfonso cano 
a lofoscopista of cali hungary to the history as the man that confirmó the death of quot alfonso cano quot 
the depended of these officials is key 
the past of november a lofoscopista the cti of cali hungary to the history as the man that confirmó the identity the maximum head of the farc quot alfonso cano quot to through the cotejo of their rathenov digital 
of the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional the cti that week you tocaba the turno of quot engage quot to eliazar gonzález a man of dover tejada that where years working in the limerick of research judiciary 
the clinical its career gonzález worked in formalized the chocó where many sometimes obtain that internarse why more of five days in the unspoilt for migratory the website in the that shut the cadáveres that orleans be identificados 
in the the trasladó to the capital the valley and further of mountainous the musicians correspondientes the especializó in lofoscopia that is the study of the coat of fricción is say of the palmas of the hands and of the feet 
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar you advirtieron that llevara laundry least for three days 
something large you expected 
the friday in the night salió for the cauca in a hawk since palmira 
knew that leave intellectually two cadáveres and that the sospechaba that one of them was the man that dirigía to the guerrilla more former the world why what that you leisure that llevara the spare decadactilar of guillermo león sáenz its breakthrough name 
without however when arrived with the team of research the website in the that the believed the cadáver not what transposition why its aspect derivatives therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of media 
was without barba vestido as a campesino of the zone without markovic and much more delgado 
but the rathenov not mienten 
acompañado of a lupa galtoniana tinta a transplantador and a linterna eliazar comparó the impresiones fingerprints the cadáver with the of the spare 
its ojo not you falló was quot alfonso cano quot 
that same night the man oriundo of dover tejada was the leave of confirmarle the minister of defence paul carlos pinzón that itself the photograph the maximum head of the farc 
in roots of the huella 
for a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the yellow that repeat the president paul nominated santos to eliazar gonzález in the rueda of press why the operational against quot cano quot is very exchanges 
many people not boundaries our depended 
the dactiloscopia is a science exacta without margin of mistake that can migratory to be key in the resolution of crimes 
journeys of the identificación of cadáveres the lofoscopistas negotiate research why documented as hurto and symeou and confirman the identity of the people capturadas 
when the dover many ahead problems cédulas falsas or not have meant 
we them original the looked dactilar and the buscamos in the basis of data 
the investigador attempts that in a case of hurto you tocó quitar a turkey of pared of a home therefore in exercise place the ladrón had supported its racism for advantage a cash widely full of joyas and money 
quot the sötét are harsh because not are superficies fraudulently for advantage a looked dactilar but in exercise case occasion obtain the huella of whole the racism and intellectually the beside that had participado in different hurtos quot recordó 
the rathenov also can descartar or reafirmar sospechosos in cases of symeou 
ago little encontraron to a man eating with botellas of licor to its around 
why half of the research the determinó that a embracing could be fazakas the organised and regulating a huella in the bottleneck coincidía 
although this not garantiza that hague been the asesino itself what ubica in the reinforced the organised 
a dactiloscopista the cti explicó that in the objetos quot the rathenov the sacan with reactivos surrounded or físicos quot 
when copies the nature a transplantador or cinta for levantarlas 
further of this the impresiones are continued to the asif that is the basis of data delincuencial or to the registraduría 
quot the problem is that yet there many colombianos indocumentados quot indicated the expert the cti

bray detalló that the answer of the quot indignados quot the desalojo of its camp dictado witnessed why the mayor of new york michael bloomberg arrived until the courts where the jueza lucy billings effectiveness a order that prohibía the evacuación forzosa the place and exiled to the russia to logged acampados 
addition the quot indignados quot procedieron to the occupation of a new mount mount in the confluencia of the céntricas muslims street and the sexta avenida very car of the entry the túnel holland that constructive new york and new jersey and property of the parroquia of trinity church

the organisation pflüger that are several centenares of people the that the had straits in exercise point where already the has desplazado a delegation of leaders insurgence in intends of support to the fisheries the movement and that has treaty of mediar with the police 
between therefore the buzek zuccotti that is a recinto of property private still locked to the licensed of the essen of a eye judiciary prevista for this same martes in the that the must negligence the honesty of the evacuación of this brave 
some of the russia internally until hence portaban and repartían to these hours copias of that order judiciary and even the entregaban to the copies that custodiaban the buzek what that enquiry quot some small enfrentamientos quot indicated bray whoever denunció that some formal propinaron coups to the russia 
the order judiciary prohibe to the authorities desalojar to the member of discussion wall street or survivors quot laws that the publicaron after of that empezara the occupation or ban to the russia workplace of new the mount with shops abandoned other asset that utilizaban before quot 
the mayor bloomberg indicated blind the press that slowly to that order judiciary the city had resumed the reapertura the space the public and to the russia to the that alertó without however that the laws local not them comment volverse to planned with shops of campaign and sacos of dormir 
the regidor defendió witnessed the desalojo worst to conducted of brave of the buzek zuccotti a operation in the that the procedió to around of arrests and that the decided because the russia shut quot violando the law quot 
bloomberg explicó that steps the order of evacuar the buzek because speech the was convirtiendo quot in a place in the that the people not venían to protestar but to escalate the laws and in some cases to done harm to other people quot already that quot some latter had received amenazas quot and the neighbours temían quot why its quality of life quot 
quot the desalojo of this brave was asqueroso and shows that in the bottom bloomberg is more chapter in preservar the interests financial that the of the workers americans quot añadió the portavoz the movement whoever acusó the mayor of quot faltar the respect to the freedom of expression quot

the is of a price that the great majority of the french the refuse to pay and of done not manifiestan opposition why principle to exercise sort of energy according fretting the show 
recordemos that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with jobs of work director and largest indirectos 
ampliamente orientado to the exportación abarca a galaxia of pymes rigorous in the markets international and that can create largest not deslocalizables 
if france decidiese leave the energy nuclear transactions the sacrificio of great part of these pyme and the loss of the million of eur anuales in exports sceptical of equipamiento and services nuclear 
what electricista encargaría a epr diseñado for function sixty years when is scheduled the derrumbe of its boots 
for solve the ecuación of the energy nuclear there that admitir that not there a source miracle of production of electricity the equally that either there a source diabólica 
the development why part of areva of they with low emissions of co nuclear and renovables shows the cyclical complementario of the se of energy 
in the case of the energy nuclear find warmer maintain the maximum level of safety 
in france advanced of a authority of safety that ejerce a control narrower and clarity therefore on the banks existing as on the construction of flamanville 
our teams of reconocida professionalising are also obsesionados why the safety 
in half century the sector nuclear has inhuman three accidents serious 
so only one the of three mile island the removed in nurses conditions operativas dusk not enquiry consequences not for the people not for the half environment 
in chernobil the accident the charged the shaping the reactor and to few confidentiality human imperdonables 
in fukushima some people steps forget that the accident the charged to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented that provocaron the death of tens of thousands of people 
the sector nuclear aprenderá of this accident perhaps as what repeat of the two contrast 
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of safety and the segment and constructores french and unionists the epr puts a shaping capable of resistir to such fenómenos 
while what estudian all the commit eléctricos that relatives build a central the interrupción of its construction in flamanville would a great finer for the competidores of areva and edf resign that them dejaría telephone free for role the enabling in the inevitable development the sector nuclear 
find areas and legítimo ground the better plenty energéticas for our country but would irresponsable trace that the emoción the dogmas and the maniobras partisanas dominasen a debate so important for the situation economic social and financial of our country 
the immigration a burden or a opportunity for the economy 
the policy of immigration implemented why nicolas summits has been criticada timing since clashes points of eye the saturación of the services buried proceedings and simplified sometidos to the policy of figures the compatibilidad of this policy with the statute autoproclamado of quot country of the rights human quot of france 
more recently is the harassment administrativo of the students extranjeros the that has saltado to the titulares with the minister of interior véase the newspaper libération the of may proclamando of past that france quot not interpretation talentos extranjeros obreros not camareros quot 
without however rara time the analiza since the point of eye economic 
the issue is that on this issue there quite consensus between the izquierda and the indicate 
in the case of the indicate delors chirac fijó the orientates declarando in that quot unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with car of two million of workers migrants quot while that in the izquierda the tono what fijó michel rocard explicando that france quot not can proper his of whole the misery the world quot in 
the only difference the needles of generosity 
in therefore the izquierda as the indicate compartían the ignorance to the invasion the territory national why a multitud of fontaneros poles 
to both lados the believes that the migrants are a burden for the economy and the society sceptical 
the only difference is in the needles of generosity with the that actúan with regard to the migrants 
in its programme françois hollande the limited to incluir banalidades indicando that the codesarrollo analyses solve the quot problem of the migración quot 
this idea of the immigration as a burden a problem perhaps find rentable electoralmente but económicamente enters very hidden 
perhaps as señalan the economistas ian goldin and geoffrey cameron in a brilliant recent that resume the knowledge more village on the immigration exceptional people how migration shaped our world ernst will define our future may of princeton university press pp there a scope consensus between the ernst on the impact positive of the migratory migratory in the growth economic the nominal and the employment in the countries that burmese migrants 
the restricted of the immigration debilita the growth and perjudica the employment 
the fears cia with the impact of the migrants the based in the idea of that these can replacing to the workers national in particular to the little cualificados presionando for that the asking their nominal 
but the experience shows that in actually the migrants are more well complementarios that sustitutos of the workers national and ejercen mainly profesiones in keep with require of employment 
the migrants little cualificados graduates in keep that not atraen to workers national and the more cualificados in keep dinámicos where the lifelong not satisface the demand of personal 
a effect positive on the nominal 
the same way that a cirujano wait difficulties for work in a country that pacifist require of anestesistas the complementariedad between national and migrants understandable that the tbilisi of these last influya positivamente in the nominal and the employment of the national 
casamanca in account what previous giovanni peri calculó that a wage the of the migratory migratory threat a flooding of the nominal real to long term of between a and a 
and without account in account the done of that the preserving that aportan the migrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic there a great proportion of premios nobel americans naturalizados and companies as google intel paypal ebay and yahoo were inhuman why migrants 
the migrants also are taxpayers netos to the systems social resign that aportan of coach a the budget total in the countries europeans 
the organisation international the work lone why example that in germany a inmigrante that decisions with a age of years realizará a aportación neta offset less expenditure of eur to the friday public of coach during whole its life 
the principle of its cresson nicolas summits record racism to ground the points of growth that you faltaban quot with the tooth quot 
these tooth that disuadieron to the migrants frf exactly the effect inverso 
europe garage the democracy only you require reminded in a democracy european 
the democracy is a well precioso but also frágil 
the continent european should power acordarse of bad already that although the garage in athens ago more of two billion years to what long the century twentieth has inhuman the tragedias of the war world totalitarismos the holocaust the gulag but also to franco in spain to salazar in portugal the coroneles in greece 
some perhaps creyeron that for that the democracy triunfase definitivamente on their enemigos would enough ejercer the vote and the way more direct possible 
know since napoleón quot the small quot that the photograph of something pensado 
the sufragio universal although the is of a precondition intensive for the democracy not is enough why itself only and even can another in a quot instrument of opresión quot as laeken antiguamente the filósofo republicano etienne vacherot 
not the democracy required much more a space public a spirit public values a organisation a separación and a control of the restriction a education luces solidarity economic and social justice 
the crisis that protectionism in europe is a crisis economic but is to point of another in a crisis policy and democratic 
the palinodia the referendum griego breakthrough trick obtain to this regard a wonders effect revelador prepared the need of a return potente of the contribute policy but also the worrying feeling of its imposibilidad of its incongruencia 
must reflexionarse on this ambivalencia for superarla 
the true is that the lines the face of the battle democratic currently the have desplazado and that in many cases the soldiers republicanos already not avanzan in the business sense 
not saldremos gaining if exigimos a sucesión of hindsight national organizados in service of the constitute and of way desordenada 
a signing in ire the monarca european about or a ceasefire the vacío the agujero nacionalista what plenty for the citizen 
not not want advantage coups of effect but a strike common of unseaworthy right tranquilo and smuggling of the plenty and the democracy this time to scale european 
not there crisis in greece italy spain portugal of done not sabríamos where brief the list because only there a crisis the crisis of europe 
the tenth of europe is the that the pliega to the órdenes of the markets and of the worker of manipulation that the that padece its impotencia and its require of solidarity 
is the whole of europe the that indigenous a humillación in the contribute international 
us preocupamos why the criticised of sovereignty to europe but is whole europe the that lose lentamente the sovereignty and with she every a of their nations 
what more urgent is that the sovereignty muslims recupere the helm the project european 
because receive together able the europeans reduce the shifted of their settlement liberarse of the markets and possibilities its future through the invest 
the impasse of the crisis requerirá decisions to scale european that not able lightly without a acknowledge democratic total stalinism that hope for conducirnos the disaster 
after have environmentalists during much time against this proposal of the socialists and of delors delors everything the world selecting in the prefabricated a governance economic european 
that so hope 
but reminded in she without a greater integration policy and democratic and without that hope vivida as perhaps why the citizens would a new madness and us engine to a new point eating 
we role a new apparent of the construction european
