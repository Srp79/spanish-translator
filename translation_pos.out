a majestic strategy for hinder the re of obama 
the republican leaders justify its policy for the need of fight against the electoral fraud . 
now well , the centre brennan viewed this finally a myth and says that the electoral fraud is least prevalent in the united states that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a lighter . 
of done , the lawyers republican not have found more that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states in ten years . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation . 
in that sense , these minarán measures in part the democratic system american . 
the contrary of what that happens in canada , the states americans are responsible of the organisation of the federal elections in the united states . 
and in that same line a majority of the governments americans banning , to onwards of 2009 , new laws that seal the process of register or of vote . 
this phenomenon has blew after the elections of november of 2010 , that forced the increase of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states . 
in consequence , during the year 2011 the introduced 180 projects of law that tighter the exercise the right of vote in 41 states . 
the new electoral laws demand that the constituents organigramme a document of identity with a photograph , addition of a test of american citizenship . 
for another part , these laws appropriations the periods of vote abolish , invalidan the right to enrol as forrester in the day the polling and resolved its right the vote to the citizens with criminal background . 
before of the elections of 2006 , no state american gil that the constituents presentaran a document of identity with photograph . 
the state of sen was the first in demand . 
the court supreme of the united states confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of sen . 
for this , the authorities republicanas the quick to expand that practice to other states . 
in the years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the constituents to submit a document of identity with photograph . 
is important have in account that , the contrary of what that happening in quebec , the citizens americans not redress of a document of identity universal , as the card of the social security . 
of done , 11 % of the citizens americans , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not discharge with no document of identity with photograph issued for an agency government of its state . 
for another side , five million of new constituents in 2012 reproaches of a document of identity with these characteristics . 
but , to often , the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars . 
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way disproportionate to the young , the minorities and the people with income netherlands . 
in effect , 25 % of afroamericanos , 15 % of people that earn least of 35.000 dollars the year , 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and 20 % of the constituents of between 18 and 29 years not discharge with a document of identity with photograph . 
and still there more . 
in many states the students , the constituents that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with photograph issued for its institution . 
for another part , these ourselves states authorise to the member of the kallas of fisheries or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republican to use the documents emitted for these kallas . 
before of 2004 no state gil the test of citizenship for vote . 
arizona was the first state in submit deficit demand . 
since 2011 , a dozen of states has adopted laws that demand that the constituents deserve that are citizens americans . 
these measures looking , clearly , limit the vote hispano . 
seems be that two of each three constituents hispanos support the party democrat . 
for another side , the republican lawmakers supported in 2011 criticisms laws that abolían the register of constituents the same day the polling in eight states . 
addition , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the constituents that regrettable enrol . 
these restrictions have consequences . 
for example , in the elections broadly of 2004 , the campaigns of register of the constituents contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens . 
the intentional measures since 2009 reformation that the rate of register of new constituents nowhere in 2010 in comparison with the year 2006 . 
addition , the republican lawmakers künast laws in other five states that importantly the reduction the period of vote for advance . 
for example , in the elections of 2008 in florida , 33 % of the constituents that voted for advance were afroamericanos , while that these years not hardware more that 13 % of the constituents the state . 
in the case of the hispanos included exactly what same . 
these not represent more that 11 % of the constituents , what that equivalent to 24 % of the citizens that vote for advance . 
however , the white , that represent 76 % the electorate , not represent more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote for advance . 
for course , the lawmakers democrats and their supporters the have theories wholeheartedly to the adoption of laws that restrictive the registration of constituents . 
in this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law . 
the ministry tax of the united states intervened for suspend the laws more controversial . 
the could , in part , limit the damage . 
for example , so only 16 of 34 künast states the law that gil the presentation of a document of identity with photograph . 
however , is undeniable that the new intentional rules complicarán the exercise the right to vote in 2012 . 
the critics democrats bullied the character partisan of the laws that the have voted , already that is clear that with them the intend influence in the results of 2012 in the states key . 
a report the centre brennan of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted impoverished laws represent 171 of the 270 necessary votes in the electoral school for achieve the presidency . 
is too soon for hindsight with certainty if these legislative changes to scale of electoral system will a significant impact in the results of the presidential elections of 2012 . 
a thing is certain : these new provisions affect adversely to the rate of participation . 
in this sense , the minarán measures in part the democratic system american . 
detection the cancer of prostate : asking the persistence or not apprising ? 
in effect , the persistence of external psa , in occasions , erroneous results , with false negative results or even false positive results , after the that the decides perform medical interventions useless . 
is a reason more that enough for do bonino to the men , reticentes already of for yes , on if should asking or not the diagnostic of detection . 
asking the persistence or not ? 
we asked council to two specialists . 
in the studies in the united states the mattel a great index of chlamydia between the groups of is , for what that is difficult interpret these data and do recommendations ground . 
for its part , the study european showed certain difference of mortality between the patients that the had done the detection and the that not . 
the study , with a follow to the 12 years , demonstrated addition that there between the 30 and the 40 % of possibilities of infirm metastases if not has done the persistence of detection . 
recommend , for therefore , the persistence to onwards of the 50 years , or to onwards of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate . 
the men of origin afroamericano have an index of risk more high . 
the key is clamp a good decision an once detected the cancer . 
there aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolentes . 
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of its cancer . the him must offer all the possible options and not necessarily treat the cancers of prostate that not contravention against the life to long term , in whose case the must earmarked more well for an active surveillance of the disease . 
today in many day men to the that the them has detected a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer is not aggressive nor revolutions a risk for its life . 
in its place , them delors an active surveillance of the disease and , if is onus , them offer a treatment . 
determinamos each once with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty . 
recommend that the gander the persistence in any case . 
but is important that please with its doctor for determine if must asking the persistence or not . 
movember has created , in collaboration with the international society of urología , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros the persistence of psa .

cure the disease 
unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for cure the cancer . 
to despite of the progress of the investigations , the adoption of habits of life tendency remains still the better way of reduce the risks of suffer the disease . 
eco that if everything the world comiera well and the asking what enough , the could cure 30 % of the cancers . 
&quot; if nobody buses , that rate the expenditure , the least , the 50 % &quot; , underlines andré genève , spokesman of the society canadian against the cancer . 
in change , evaluamos that around the 10 % of the cancers are inherited . 
many other remains still completely explainable . 
for the society canadian against the cancer , the fight against the smoking remains a priority to despite of the drop the number of smokers . 
the tobacco is sörensen with the 85 % of the cases the cancer of lung . 
is , addition , a factor of risk for other types of cancers . 
inflicts enormously the health of the people . 
&quot; today for today , still there 1,5 million of smokers in quebec &quot; , declared the spokesman genève andré . 
an universally auspicious : 10 years after of stop of smoking , the risk of die of cancer the reduces to the half . 
the weight 
the gordura and the obesity decentralization also the appearance of the disease , according the scc . 
tailbacks the risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of rectal , of oesophagus , of erosive and of womb . 
&quot; the investigations shown that the practice regulate of physical activity during whole the life protects against the cancer of breast &quot; , add . 
the food 
the atomic advised , equally , limit the consumption of meats shirts . 
in large quantities , do ladder the risks of suffer a cancer colorectal . 
the products of charcutería also must avoided . 
the preservation of the meat for its ahumado , fodder or can herrings sino the training of carcinogenic substances . 
can &quot; studio the cells the atomic and wear the development the cancer &quot; , us reasons . 
the vitamins 
in the years , several scientists have studied the ties between the complex vitamin and the cancer . 
however , for the moment their investigations not are unconvincing . 
segú the scc , the studies about of the osteoporosis and are contradictory . 
while that in one of them the iaea a drop of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that the observed was , more well , an increase . 
the effect of the osteoporosis d in the cancer either has able determine with clarity . 
for another part , m. genève hürriyet in the importance of speak on the concerns and the background relatives of each one with its doctor . 
&quot; do the persistence of detection arouses not cancer . &quot; 
the bosón of higgs in detail 
the announcement the likely discovery the bosón of higgs generated a great commotion the summer past , and with reason . 
the believes , in effect , that this bosón is involve the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least . 
and what that is more , the is of the partícula whose existence snowfalls the model standard : our better or &quot; bad least &quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the bioethanol , that still has not been notice empirically . 
but for the physical is not completely clear that the conceal of higgs . 
know however place to doubts that there a new partícula and that the seems much the bosón of higgs predicted for the model standard . 
addition , new data desvelados this week in an important congress of physical instructors in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is , although still manuals more data for be completely insurance . 
of all ways , assume that the is of higgs , already that the possibilities of captivated few seem . see of what the is . 
there , in this great world , a law widespread and absolutely that means that two things not can dialogues in the same place the same time . 
not there way of infringing that rule and not what pretty too , because ready suppressing harm . 
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , has demonstrated that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can occupy the same space the same time if are in the same &quot; state cuántico &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that collaborate , roughly way , of some of their characteristics . 
the physical qualified the particles in two categories . 
for a part us encounter with the good citizens called fermiones , that co2 wisely the principle of pauli . 
and for another are the bosones , an underwear buffoons of anarquistas that has not respect for nothing , or the least not for this principle , what that mean that can dialogues in the same place and the same time . 
according the website the particle adventure of the laboratories berkeley that , for true , is extraordinary , the bosones the split in two groups : the landlords , of the that discuss not here , and the &quot; particles of strength &quot; , for the that the large forces of the nature the spreading and with the subjects the bosón of higgs emptiest of some way emparentado . 
these bosones , dressed underline here , not are the exotic bichos that could believing . 
of done , if sack read this foretold , is thank to a bosón extremely trivial : the fotón or the &quot; partícula of light &quot; that acts as &quot; messenger &quot; of the electromagnetic strength . 
in effect , when a partícula with a burden electricity accelerates or flux of direction , &quot; desordena &quot; the field electromagnético in that must environment ; a little as when penny a stone to a pond . 
in this &quot; mess &quot; delta an electromagnetic wavelength ( of the light , of the infrared , of the laser , etc. ) , and this wavelength is not another thing that a fotón ; is say , one of the bosones &quot; eels of strength &quot; . 
field more stable 
happens what same with the bosón of higgs , with the difference of that the is of another field , the field of higgs , that needs be &quot; desordenado &quot; for that this bosón hang . 
now well , the field of higgs is deal more stable that the field electromagnético . for activarlo ago lack reach to renewables lorries extremely , a little as if the robot of a pond pisa in the that so only a rock gruesa impinge varied for the surface . 
for this ago lack a relapse accelerating of particles as the of the megascience ( the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of circumference ! ) for such achieve levels of energy . 
the analogy with the field electromagnético is a new tool that explains the relationship between the higgs and the mass . 
of done , not all the particles nor all the materials blundell with the field electromagnético . 
some , as the imams , what do , but other not : a piece of role , for example , not the quota never for same yes grass to the door of a freezing . 
and of the same way , not all the particles blundell with the field of higgs : the that what do have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fotón , for true ) , not the have . 
now well , what &quot; can proof &quot; all these investigations ? , question the madam plamondon . 
for the science , this serves for verify the validity the model standard ( ms ) , and allows , addition , that the physical escrutinen the differences between the comments and the predictions the ms . 
for its part , many want wholeheartedly that the cork , therefore the lower could difference open a door to a new &quot; physical &quot; that tape conceals holes the model . 
this , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that proposes not explanation some qualitative to the severity ( ups ! ) or to the bioethanol dark , that constitutes around the 80 % of the bioethanol the universe ( another ups ! ) . 
but not we found such differences in the megascience until the moment . 
impact 
the impact of impoverished investigations in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not believe that us mistaken the say that not will no . 
for that eurovision : to beginning of the years 60 , the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not sospechaban in absolute the revolution that their provocarían jobs . 
entreveían the scientific applications , but nothing more . 
of done , as already said the physical willard boyle , that worked in the laboratories bell , where the invented the infrared in 1960 , and that booklet the first infrared continuous ( the first were pulsados ) in 1962 , the principle the infrared was more well considered a &quot; tall of laboratory &quot; . 
imagine ... 
and addition , the can applications also proceed of whole the implementing that surrounds to the research . 
for example , the same willard boyle booklet a captador of light in 1969 in the tendering of its research in bioethanol of angles . 
to despite of that not was in absolute its original intention , this captador serves now of &quot; eye &quot; for all the apparatus digital the world , what that him sway the nobel of physical in 2009 . 
that wants not say , for course , that the activities the lhc organize necessarily outer our lives , but that never the knows ... 
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; him devoir 
in its commission die in dignity , quebec indian recently the sensitive issue the end of the life . 
the must debate battle soon while the prepares a project of law . 
now well , within of that dominance essential , still there much that do . 
him devoir has tried remains of closely . 
ago hardly to weeks , the sr. l. fringes only in its ecuadorean of the montérégie . 
the cancer of prostate that him was destroying him had given a respite of two years . 
&quot; i had given five years of life , but already wearing so seven &quot; , tracing , done a running , casualty in its bed in the centre of palliative care victor-gadbois of beloeil , to the that arrived the previous day . 
&quot; but is always a shock , not we be prepared for this &quot; , continues . 
the disease him has caused havoc : an enormous weakness that him prevents go only the bath and even eat for yes only . 
desk front to an apetitoso lunch , piracy mood that him assist to eat . 
courageous , arrives even to clamped , to speak with the strangers that him invent attention , him practice medicines and him offered a bath . 
the courage of the death ordinary . 
&quot; my greater wish is that i curen the parasitic , is humiliating &quot; , admits . 
to hours more afternoon , the team found remedy to that wrong . 
&quot; in the tendering of our lives saving that a man ago pis of foot &quot; , tracing pierre brodeur , psychologist in the centre victor-gadbois . 
returning to its childhood , for criticisms people , is an unacceptable humiliation . 
&quot; that depends of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &quot; , relate . 
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in palliative care , the large moments have place in the heart same of that regression . 
all the patients that militia in the centre of palliative care victor-gadbois packet cancer . 
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months . 
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them foolishly already not offered the care &quot; curative &quot; . 
the greater fear of the sra. a. , of 89 years , is die &quot; aware and ahogada &quot; . 
but the disease him has done compromising to their children . 
&quot; i few good children &quot; , adds . 
&quot; already i don &apos;t remain more wishes in this life &quot; , says , before of accept that the him absurd a mascarilla for overcoming to breathe . 
and expected , in the coming days , a final visit of its son that venus in italy . 
in victor-gadbois the offers , with a group of voluntary , the careful the body and aid to the food . 
are care palliative that the them give when not the can do nothing more . 
for help to that its death be more confortable . 
in credible quebec with a bed of palliative care for each 11.700 inhabitants . 
is very little , already that know that all terrorists fisherman some day . 
here , the life continues in the best possible conditions , explains the dra. christiane martel , an of the male the centre . 
already be to level of physical comfort , emotional or spiritual . 
the moribundo the him offered enjuagues of mouth with brandy or pepsi , according the demand . 
to the diabetics already not the them controls its rate of sugar . 
the death way part of what everyday . 
yesterday for the night him uses a beer the sr. x , that died in the tendering of the night . 
this tomorrow , its son the ended the beer to the feet the keenly . 
&quot; helping therefore to the patients as to their beings dear &quot; , tracing sylvie savard , arco of the care . 
in the centre victor-gadbois the days discussions however be never equal . 
the side of a man of 94 years that saborea its final meeting family in the yard , well categorized between their almohadas while all sweet to its health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounds for their parents , its woman and their two children , after read tried everything for survive . 
&quot; since ago six months , always there of three to five caged overcrowded for people minors of 45 abnormal years of cancer &quot; , the concerned the dra. christiane martel . 
53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre victor-gadboisarrivent next of its home and 47 % the hospital . 
problem the access to care palliative 
77 % of the canadians simply has not access to the care palliative , is say , to the care nationally for alleviate the suffering when a herd arrives to the terminal stage of its life , be in its petrova , in the hospital or in a centre of care . 
and several bodies , as the centre victor-gadbois and the society of palliative care to petrova the montréal grand , the especializan almost exclusively in the careful of the patients with cancer . 
is precisely that great qualitative deficit in the care health of quebec what that ago that many doctors specializing in palliative care fisherwoman the adoption of a law that noise the euthanasia and the suicide assisted . 
since the month of october , a maroni signed for eminencias of the care palliative , as the dr. balfour mount and the dr. reginald lapointe , moves for demonstrate its opposition to perhaps initiative . 
according the dra. christiane martel , the system health of quebec is not what enough competent as for ensure that anyone successful right to care palliative of quality before of that the accepted proceed with the euthanasia . 
&quot; recently &quot; , tracing , &quot; i seen to a patient pass 14 days in topical large suffering chills however that the hague done what necessary for relieve . 
fear that the patients insensitive die only because not receive the suitable care &quot; . 
and parallel , many oncólogos the obstinan with their patients until the finally day , to despite of the worst investor . 
the hopes of survival of hélène richard were already under bare when brushed a treatment of chemotherapy exhausting . 
&quot; when him said to my oncóloga that wanted rockets the treatment , she i said that him terrorised very worth that like stop of fight &quot; , tracing . 
&quot; however , she i had said that not had nothing more that do ! &quot; 
not there care todopoderosos 
the dra. martel believes that 90 % of the azt that dropped die grateful to their carers that not them originates remarkably in their demands an once the them has relieved its pain thank to a team of palliative care . 
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely todopoderosos in what that concerning the treatment the pain . 
according elsie monereau , arco of the care palliative to petrova of montréal grand , the patients not responsive to the treatments against the pain in 8 % of the cases . 
the final of the life , the doctors usually resort to the sedating egf , that serves for ball the patient until the moment of its haemorrhaging , already be of way sporadically or of way permanent . 
not we pretend that not understand that part the suffering . 
each once more , the disease not reassured going to have the possibility of have that sedating egf . 
the azt that not are aliviados say all what same : &quot; i want die &quot; . 
but that wants not say necessarily &quot; want the euthanasia &quot; , but &quot; want that i alivien &quot; . 
the realisation of this ihned has been possible thank to a grants of journalism of the institutes of research of health of canada . 
promotional í of great infringing in quebec 
officials of the network proliferated , employers the instable , despised of funds of political parties and specialists of the mafia italian discharge , day after day , what that know of an enthuses &quot; system &quot; , the that form part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and landing . 
a &quot; industry &quot; that went too expensive to the taxpayers natives , on everything in the years 1990 and 2000 . 
&quot; is remarkable how the system the pulveriza an once we hunted to the large media &quot; , ironiza jacques duchesneau , member in quebec and former head of the police of montreal . 
him lideró the outbreak the scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to fund on the monies compounded to contracts of roads in quebec , that the first minister liberal of that moment , jean charest , not had presumed more that in likeness . 
the &quot; report duchesneau &quot; set a link direct between the industry , the funding nationals of the parties and the corruption between officials . 
&quot; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the ministry of transport the would saved billion million of dollars in contracts &quot; , analysing some of their instincts of stay with a proportional part . 
the commission charbonneau &quot; has already done sink to two mayors &quot; , adds , while expected power reach to &quot; demonstrate the ploys existing behind of the individuals &quot; . 
an unit permanent require , created in 2011 
the unit permanent require , created in 2011 , the applies also with its team of controllers , researchers and analysts the government . 
this unit work addition of the policemen of &quot; the maps marteau &quot; , that , since 2009 , have done that the &quot; cartel the undue &quot; of montreal the modere to the hour of inflating contracts . 
these latter weeks , the unit has adjusted the registration in series of the accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a city of the tbilisi . 
the next of the would list savary vaillancourt , that just of resign of its since of mayor of laval , third city of quebec . 
the suspicion that has embolsado destructive bribery to change of public contracts . 
has accused formally to engineers of the network proliferated of montreal and to employers of italian origin , as tony accurso and wales zambito . 
this has finally caused commotion the explain to the commission the mechanical the &quot; system &quot; of obtaining of public contracts . 
him same salmaan during three years 3 % the value of the contracts results in montreal to a broker inseparably to the mafia that transfirió the money to montréal dimension , the party the mayor gérald tremblay . 
m. zambito repartió money to congratulatory and congratulatory during the years 2000 , granting more of 88.000 dollars canadians ( few 68.000 eur ) to provincial parties , on everything to the liberals in the power . 
admitted , equally , have organised a laptops of illegal funds for the ex-viceprimera minister liberal , sylvie normandeau . 
the inflation the cost of the contracts of undue 
in montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption severely with effectively . 
savary surprenant , exingeniero of public works , what explained perfectly foremost the commission : in ten years received gifts , inviting to travels , torneos of golf , restaurants , parties of hockey and bribery of companies the sector of the construction for a total of 736.000 dollars , everything this to change of contracts of undue whose costs flair . 
other officials of the network proliferated have admitted that received money for inflating the bills between 30 % and 40 % in concept of false extra . 
addition , an organiser the party the mayor , martin dumont , unauthorised to m. tremblay of have done the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and pleased their coffers of money dirty . 
to root of these revelations , m. tremblay resigned to principles of november and transaction to montreal to an enormous crisis . 
chantal rouleau was an of the stages policies listened of montreal that did sound the alarm . 
as cresson the district of rivière-des-prairies , in the this of the island , the opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground romantic municipal for 5 million of dollars and revendido for 1,6 million to the promoters in plenary boom estate . 
the 70 % the money of the electoral campaigns was money dirty 
of the research that finally the xenophobic to carried , she pflüger that remuneration &quot; of a thread for power understand the functioning the system , infiltrado for hormigas , for rockets the gangrena and fishing to the culprits &quot; . 
and adds that the process is &quot; painful , but positive &quot; . 
we sacrificed the injuries but newspapers lack an unit of research clean in montreal and be very vigilant for that the dubious practices not the repeated . 
how do the cleanliness . 
regularly . 
jacques duchesneau , for its part , sets that &quot; the officials have stolen hundreds of million of dollars &quot; , but is inquieto on everything for the role of the &apos; political &quot; elected the aware of the ploy &quot; . 
estimando in 70 % the proportion of money dirty that the liquidity to the funding of electoral campaigns in quebec , ironiza : &quot; i have said that is not more that a plaster parent of the reality &quot; . 
the government quebequés proposes limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties , but that not change the donation , according him , &quot; while not the crucially strictly the electoral expenditure , will money dirty in the policy &quot; . 
philosophical a full review the system of licensing of public contracts and of funding of the parties : &quot; not we sink more under ; go the fund of the things , with courage , us allow rebuild the home with to foundations more hurriedly , with more controls and laws &quot; . 
if this history sacconi the international image of quebec and of montreal , m. duchesneau invites to those that the smugglers to mirror the mirror . 
&quot; the psg is not the fc barcelona ! &quot; 
this season has romantic a new entity with the psg . 
how outbursts that breakthrough ? 
the could explain for a decision of individual awareness , but also for the new dimension the psg . 
have come large players . 
avanzo of day in day to its side . 
the personal technician also i has oostlander much . 
and these elements i migration to daily to raising the level of my game . 
in a party , that is more easy . 
everything going very rapid in the football . 
but i don &apos;t acaloro . 
since my beginning in the centre of preformación of inf clairefontaine until my step for saint-etienne , always i moved to steps leaps . 
going to obtain benefit of the competition reclutada for carlo ancelotti . 
the recruitment of this summer are utilising to gala parties of very high level . 
know that each training is crucial . 
that ago that a player as i successful cork of fight and help everything . 
for another part , carlo ancelotti i provided much in concerned to my enabled . 
is broadly for ambassadors as claude makelele , that jugaba in the same position that i . 
ancelotti is the man that plea the team ? 
for course . 
ancelotti ala respect to all the technical . 
today for today , not there equals nobody in the league 1 and is between the best entrenadores europeans . 
has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best kallas . 
has worked with large players . 
believe that the xenophobic other titles in paris . 
in january had a conversation very comforting with him . 
i rebuilt of escape of a series of injury . 
the confidence that has in me explains also my good performance . 
what thinks on the psg in the first part of the season ? 
in the league 1 , lyon us has musharraf the since of leader . 
but keep in the ambush . 
one of our elderly objectives is the league of champions : us we embarrassing for the octavos of final with style . 
what is the objective the club in this australian ? 
going to treat of reach what more far possible . 
to onwards of now , can pass any thing . 
but we much that say front to many and very good teams europeans . 
want , for start , crack the first of our league front the oporto for power receiving the motor of octavos of final . 
the can psg norm in a great european club to short term ? 
has already the budget ... 
for norm in a great european club , paris has that win titles and be it to long term . 
today for today , that is not the case . 
to economic level , the psg is baton to their media for that project the materialise . 
not win the cup in the league 1 , as in the final season , offend a great failure ? 
for course , would a great disappointment . 
this year going to invest all our efforts in wisdom that title of champions . 
in the final season not examine far . 
in may us we a disappointment , already that plan with the conditions privileged for started first . 
had a strong season . 
coal with 79 points . 
normally , with 79 should points have been champions ... 
but another team , the montpellier , had a season quite better . 
this year believe that will the good . 
even if the large teams as the marseille , the lyon and the bordeaux fighting for the title , believe that credible with the weapons for llevárnoslo . 
believes that the media expect more the psg ? 
is normal that fares much of us if ruled in what that has modernisation in the players that we . 
what we accepted completely . 
after of that ganáramos 4-0 in home to troyes , that still the cork with things that absence is a little frustrating . 
us ask what more expected the people . 
never pessimism win 4-0 all the purposes of week . 
not are the fc barcelona ! 
coordinate of put in direction a project of game . 
a team the inclusive with time . 
in the league of champions we demonstrated that we respond and be present . 
look the manchester that , after two ifremer , has not achieved categories for octavos of final , and them also have modernisation deal ! 
in view of the sums alas , you imaginaríamos with 15 points of advantage to the notify . 
that would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of france . 
lyon and marseille , that not were well the previous season , the have seen &quot; powered &quot; for this new psg . 
that shows that the league 1 is prevent . 
hope that in may can say with a smile that , to despite of all the difficulties , we alright llevándonos the leterme . 
the psg seems completely dependent of the successes of attackers . 
better that curate that we a &quot; zlatandependencia &quot; . 
that wants say that attackers is very competent and that many bottom goals . 
has shattered for demonstrate that is the star of the league 1 . 
and has demonstrated in all the teams for the that has past that is a great player , a star world . 
in the group honestly the man and the player . 
and him respects also to the men that has to its around . 
what that has done is truly exceptional . 
that bottlenecks to the others to increase its level of game . 
thiago silva , one of the best defenders the world , allows also that all stockholm . 
how ve lived the 2012 with the team of france ? 
has been a disappointment . 
was very enthusiastic for participate in this 2012 . 
unfortunately , my injury i prevented consecutively time of game . 
saw things it and pretty reinforced . 
today achievement playing good parties in the selection . 
is what that coming since my baptism with the &quot; blues &quot; . 
learn the lesson of what that happened in ukraine and to this the must that today hack a behaviour exemplary . 
what vision you the first month of didier deschamps the front of the &quot; blues &quot; ? 
is obtaining results . 
are well confront in the group of classification for the world . 
the selector is spelling , practicable to the players and ala to win . 
as was the case of laurent blanc . 
but not want do comparisons . 
blanc galerie its objective of clasificarnos for the 2012 . 
hope that didier deschamps shaming to the selection to brazil . 
the zero ( 1-1 ) the 16 of october in spain served for lay the foundations ? 
that game us took confidence . 
each one peleó for all . 
before of that shock in spain , not had lived a game andersson in whole my career . 
with bitcoin , pay and sell however banks 
everything what contrary to the monetary exchanges current , based in the central banks , the transactions potočari and the burdens of prosecution between the sides . 
addition , as to happens often in the technologies , the vision policy is curtailing : the conviction of that the system monetary current , cabinet of inimical bank , where to the financial crisis . 
of done , bitcoin , zuse for satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudónimo ) , is to the once a virtual currency convertible to dollars , eur , etc. and a protocol of change safe to the way of bittorrent , that allows the exchange of files of equals to equals . 
the have recorded closely of 200.000 transactions thank to 15.000 computers of the network . 
and closely of few billion website websites accepted the bitcoins as donations or as way of payment . 
the abyss the bitcoin , after have come to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 eur ) in june of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more afternoon , before of return today to haunt the ten dollars ( the contributions the censan in the website bitcoincharts.com ) . 
is not impressive nothing if what benchmarking with the changes wars in real currency or in financial products . 
however , the central bank european ( ecb ) the crusades for him in a report on the coins blogs published in october . 
in him , the described the bitcoin as &quot; the virtual currency with more success &quot; , &quot; that v with the dollar or the euro &quot; and similar &quot; to the conventional coins &quot; . 
bitcoin the difference of other systems with types of coins blogs as the &quot; appropriations &quot; , used for forward in a vídeojuego and that the can win playing or the can buy ( and even in occasions canjear ) . 
the social network facebook developed also this type of system . 
but in everything exchange a central authority controls and is the changes . 
with the bitcoin , all the nodes of network are to the trustees once of books of accounting , verifiers , issuers of currency and buyers and buyers . 
how work that network ? 
each transaction between two users the ago in reality between two electronic directions in way of mail e . 
a can user choose a direction different for each payment , assuring so the confession . 
a whole of concludes compounded to this transaction the signing defamation to through of a system of echelon to dual key . 
the can network so verify the authenticity of the transaction . 
thank the content the mens , is also possible ensure that the changes of bitcoins record in the book of public accounts , that the pvv for whole the network . 
the milestone key locally in write that new transaction in that book . 
this running for the resolution of a challenge mathematics rained to the computers and the winner , a species of central banker provisional , will the privilege of add that line supplementary . 
the is of a stage of troceado of mens , is say , of transformation of a great mens in a numerical fingerprint more short and single . 
the computers &quot; bus &quot; the new transaction and add a number before of &quot; trocear &quot; the whole . 
the objective is find the number that authoritative a particular fingerprint ( more zeros the principle ) . 
an once that the crossroads that number , the other verifican nodes easily that is the good . 
the transaction the crossroads then indestructiblemente orthodox to the chain of sets of the other transactions ; whole modification switching the fingerprint . 
if , for commit a fraud , an user like pay two sometimes with the same money very rapid ( in least of ten minutes ) , the network only islamicised as recoding an of the two transactions ; the another the stay huérfana , already that sides have different prints . 
the computer that tried the challenge the where 50 bitcoins . 
for avoid the inflation , that rewarded the divides in two regularly , with avoided before the final of 2012 . 
the number of bitcoins in movement is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but are divisible until the cienmillonésimo , what that leaves a margin broader . 
the difficulty of this challenge the strikes also in each increase of the power of calculation . 
the life of the network has already their downs . 
the websites website that offered services for bitcoin have been attacked and the have stolen bitcoins in exempting . 
&quot; the failure used not affects the same protocol &quot; , pflüger pierre noizat , that just of launch paymium , a company of payment in real currency that used the network bitcoin . 
the ecb has in account addition the possibilities of blanquo of money thank to this service anonymous . 
but the money in effective external the same defect . 
the players of weight as wikipedia reject the payments of this type . 
other , as the platform wordpress , the accepted . 
recently , abeto shamir and dorit rum , the insitito weizmann in israel , reactors the book of accounting and rolled that closely the 80 % of bitcoins moves not . 
in november the warnings the &quot; shopping giants &quot; . 
&quot; the changed 30.000 dollars &quot; , the regocija flatters holmquist , that works for coinabul , that becomes the bitcoins in gold . 
pierre noizat , author of a book hashish on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology addition of in the network of transactions . 
its system , paytunia , equivalent to a card of credit ( in real currency ) or to a payment for mobile however contact , but used bitcoin for validate the transactions , that so fixing more cheap . 
the rangoon , addition , variety its identity and can , for therefore , indifferent in the confession . 
the system is easy of put in direction in the businesses , that not have that installing new terminals nor softwares . 
them enough with supply a direction that a can telephone &quot; photographer and recognise &quot; , müller pierre noizat , that pflüger have thousands of users . 
there a movement general of review of the systems aggressor for systems more horizontal . 
will &quot; lack a time for that bitcoin the fare , but in 2013 could have a change &quot; , predice . 
for another part , in its report the ecb trialogue fridays the various risks , today curse higher , in case of that this currency successful success . 
we won of afghanistan . 
and after ? 
the troops french abandoned its area of responsibility in afghanistan ( kapisa and surobi ) . 
the nato and the must americans escape to purposes of 2014 . 
is hour of that the army spelling economics possession of its territory and that the afghan choosing its future , however wait nothing of us . 
we forcing on everything to the peasants afghan , to the that we considered terrorists . 
and to us ourselves , with our 88 soldiers murdered , more the injured and the maimed . 
the taliban discharge with foreign extremists and former heads refugees in pakistan , but to often also with peasants that reject the presence the army abroad , as in the times of the soviets . 
want defend their traditions , wholeheartedly and arcaicas , even if to their causes the merging the jihadist , the mercifully , the arab , the uzbecos or the tayikos . 
tolerados , to sometimes even wider for the local insurgents , export already not what will when the western the militant more discreet . 
the starting of the troops french of the basis of nijrab , that saw since what high of the repressing peaches of almendros thank to the appropriations french , the did for order . 
the convoys of lorry and of tanks masna to kabul however suffer no attack , spotlight for the helicopters . 
not will everywhere of taliban in kabul to onwards of end of 2014 . 
the circumstances have changed since its breakthrough irresistible between 1994 and 1996 . 
kabul was then vacuum and the country dragged in ceasefire and blood to cause of the struggles between different factions . 
its decision of control the country had been perceived as a species of liberation , the return to the security . 
the afghan have paid the price the obscurantism of their peasants terribly for the organisation al-qaeda , but its situation is not better today . 
the old muyahidines , the current government and the current taliban pragmatically the wish of maintain to the women in a position substantially . 
the main personalities of the war antisoviética sandinistas the power in 2001 . 
the have become in speculators , suppressing with governmental tries for revenderlos as algae for the refugees that have again of iran and pakistan , faults to the couple of enormous contracts usd of subcontracting . 
are desacreditados ; the majority of them not have fought . 
the people , according i heard in the field , feminism to a government that reins not earthquakes for amputated . 
many young want cork , as also the iran the that have notoriously horde of the generosity american : the leak of capital is considerable . 
the young are tired of the war and of their ideologies . 
have lived the world modern during their exilios in iran or pakistan and have ken their advantages . 
with around of 65 % of its population lower of 25 years , kabul account now same with 5 million of inhabitants , a fifth part of the population total . 
in the cities , the schools state are lax therefore of girls as of children . 
will that give work to these young that not behaving return the obscurantism of the former parties nor to the corruption of conceals leaders . 
all , including the opposition armed , are hungry of mobile . the television and their folletines turks that inherently a world modern has large admirers in everything the country . 
the army is now present . 
the assessment legitimate the authorities that want directing the country ? 
the former commanders of the fight antisoviética the worry already of vacuum the militias provincial , that huirán the central power . 
afghanistan , country of mountains , of strong local identities , should power benefit of a certain decentralization to image of the nations western . however , the united states what have wanted outer in a state centralised , with a presidential power strong , removing the since the first minister that existed since the constitution of 1964 . 
the president karzai wants not the control abroad , in particular with reason of the elections planned in april of 2014 . 
not however , its country depends of the foreign aid since the years 50 and even before . 
no industry has reestablecido their services , not has managed no embalse nor the have repaired the systems of important irrigation . 
everything is imported and not the produces nothing exception fruit and vegetables . 
the priority the leaves to the initiative private . 
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , would been necessary the control government . 
the expandió the rumour of that afghanistan possessed basin riches coal . 
and that not did more that increase the sense of that the western were it for seizing of them . 
however energy for lessons the minerals of iron or of copper the ground and however media of transport for hoof to through of the mountains , not there exploitation mining . 
the chinese already almost have abandoned the mines of copper of month aynak , letting that the international comb ( financed for the bank world ) excaven the relapse salvage búdico and frustrating there as the employers more important of the province . 
will also lack that afghanistan and pakistan , country the that depend widely the imports and the exports , restored their normal relations . 
the troops french left the 20 of november . 
the new treaty of cooperation trialogue the continuation of the traditional aid : schools of girls , schools of children , a department of french in the university , the institute french , the cooperation in the military areas , legal , health and agricultural and the support to the delegation resist . 
since 2009 , with the subjected of try &quot; winning the hearts and the tunisian &quot; and of perform the impossible task of do that the aid and the actions offensive assumptions , a service of &quot; actions civilians and military &quot; the ministry of defence ( cimic ) , rid in 2012 , brought and did bring to through of a small french ngos numerous jobs of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of towns of mountain . 
these jobs , golosos of obtain hand of local masterpiece , have able help to contain the uprising : irrigation , wells , water drinking , reforestation , trees , protection solar and increase of installing of cultivation . 
what dictate as remember after two million of eur of military expenditure ? 
a budget more well modest contribute to the improvement of the conditions of local life , very strong in these bergamo confront to often to more of 2.000 metres of height . 
the embassy received tens of demands written with small agricultural proposals interlocutors for local communities of the province of kapisa . 
for that the rescinded of the uprising opting to carried for the foreign groups , something that the farmers i have said that want , newspapers lack maintain a small aid civil , well controlled and that them comes directly . 
a constitution with fórceps in egypt 
is a new dual or nothing the president mohammed morsi . 
while that egypt is more divided that never in concerned to the constitutional declaration , that him 136 provisionally powers scrum , him decided playing the everything for the everything . 
apparently to everything the world for surprise the wednesday , when announced that the house chines vote its final text the day next . 
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to deficit house for crack their jobs . 
and ago almost two years that egypt uses a provisional text , several sometimes amended , what that distorts the institutional stability and where to judicial embrollos . 
this new initiative has not done more that increase the fractured in the country . 
for their opponents , the president upheld in its &quot; delusion autocrático &quot; and continues &quot; betraying its word &quot; and &quot; trampling the right &quot; . 
for part of their supporters , the pflüger that the is of a measure for crack more rapid with the institutional crisis and policy and speed the process of transition . 
in the coming 15 should days organised a referendum . 
a span of time very short that obliges to the muslim to renounce to its project of explain the text , article for article , to the egyptians . 
for the president , the is also of a way of recover a belatedly popular and democratic while the uproar cause havoc in everything the country . 
mohammed morsi seems convinced of that the egyptians radicals to its favour , as buffett in an interview the respectable american time . 
recital that resource has voted with very quickly , contains an ultimatum for the people hosni : &quot; or vote my text or maintain the powers scrum &quot; , powers that allegedly audience to its end with the adoption of the constitution . 
is in that environment strange in the that 85 member of this house chines , islamist in its great majority , voted the text yesterday . 
the majority of the liberals droves not to the controversies . 
to mid of november , a little before of the constitutional declaration , had closed the door because considered that not stuck do assert their points of view . 
the representatives of the rights human , the religious minorities and of the society civil made what same . 
to end of that the prefer the necessary quorum , yesterday for the tomorrow the vomited to 11 people , member substitutes , to whole haste . 
some of them are very dearest to the muslim muslims . 
as ode wait , the articles sv what have been for unanimity . 
to the commentators them ago grace , for another part , the done of that an of the few discrepancies of the notify the hague expressed virtually to the hour of the sentence , is therefore so that several member the committee arrived to think that the clock of the chines was wrong . 
the text , that yesterday afternoon was remains still voted , collaborate of 234 articles . 
the article 2 , subjected of all the expectations , remains peijs finally the of the constitution of 1971 , that wagon that &quot; the principles of the sharia constitute the source main the right &quot; . 
the parties salafistas , for those the establishment of the islamic law is a vindication fundamental , trademarks that the ribbon replace &quot; the principles &quot; for &quot; the rules &quot; , what that liked allowed an application more stricter . 
for the islamists , that this article not hague been amended is a guarantee of its good will and of its respect towards the other components of the society egyptian . 
the liberals what tachan of hypocrisy and jihadist that not the is more that of a sleight advertising . 
according them , the khartoum of the constitution the ago to through of other articles . 
the refer , in special , the article 220 , that assignment to the university al-azhar a role consultative , in particular for everything time that hague of confirm its accordance with the laws of the sharia . 
according the specialist in egypt sophie pommier , is disturbing because &quot; the people called to anyone is not concentrated and has not no democratic legitimacy . 
here detect the premises of a theocracy &quot; . 
the fears of the liberals the affected structural addition for the done of that the next rector of deficit would university quite least moderate that the current . 
&quot; for now , not there a religious involvement concrete . 
with this constitution we in the framework the state civil . 
the majority of the cci that have working in that text not are intolerantly but academics , some of them educated in the system french &quot; , explains variant blouet , that prepares a theories on the constitutional transition egyptian . 
but recognises that can have certain ambiguity in around the article 220 , therefore the terms employees imitan the vocabulary religious . 
&quot; us choice in concrete the term iqh insurmountable &#91; islamic , ndlr &#93; . 
and the question that could arise in the would future in what measure are the judges civilians competent for anyone for above of everything this &quot; . 
more beyond of its religious character , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that the refer to the powers prevalent that assignment the president of the republic . 
the muslim muslims alegarán that are few in comparison with the that were during the previous regime . 
another point contention : the powers conferred the army . 
accordance the wish of the military , the review the budget of defence not will subjected the parliament , but to a national council of defence . 
either the antique the prosecutions of civilians in military courts , as shirts the associations for the defence of the rights human . 
these also rolled their concerns relating the text , that jihadist curtailing . 
the crime of blasphemy the keeps and , of now in forward , the insults are prohibited , what that could serious spending consequences for the freedom of expression , on everything the of the press . 
addition , no article emphasises the protection of the women , underlines heba morayef , of watch . 
according she , what single positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the article 36 . 
the word not typically in the previous constitution . 
although the president hosni publishes escape yesterday for the night in the television , the capitalists demonstrations for this noon . 
the supporters the head of state the demonstrated the saturday . 
in israel , to the ukrainian tourists them expect the land holy , the exalted the world and a sea of brined

in this same place , jesus blatant foremost their disciples after of the ordained . 
but the greater amount of places santos the crossroads in jerusalem . 
the unbelievers distances here the viacrucis or the road of the cross of jesus ( in latin &quot; path synthesis &quot; ) . 
begins in the fortress of antonio , the pretorio , where the readership the trial , and continues for the streets of the city blatantly , going the tomé sepulcro in the mount gólgota , the place of the crucifixión , to the stone of the unción and the place of ancestors of jesus . 
in this same place the crossroads also the exalted symbolic ronaldo the world , that symbolises the salvation of the humanity . 
and the monastery of the cross holy in jerusalem , built in the place where , according a legend christian , had a tree the that the did the cross for the crucifixión of jesus . 
in jerusalem the crossroads also the place more sacred for the jews , the wall of the wailing ; the wreckage of a debauchery destroyed for the romans in the year 70 dc . 
as is tradition , people of different religions leaves here chords with their wishes , that then the fawn reality .

there not guides there tourist nor shops of suvenires . 
the entry is free , and categorically not the accepted donations . 
the fifth , the museum the holocaust or yad in aviv , is an of the pages more dramatic of the history . 
the section more tragic is the memorial of the children , built in memory of the 1,5 million of children murdered in the camps of concentration and the chambers of gas . 
entras in him and you sucked in absolute darkness . 
the stars brillan . 
and hypocritical the names of the children jews and the names of the countries in the that lost the life . 
ukraine the about also . 
health 
the three main areas attracting of israel the find to seacoast the sea mediterranean , the sea red and the sea died . 
in each one of them there meder , parks pedalos , delfinarios and museums oceanográficos . 
is remarkable that in the sea red the bathing even in the months of winter , already that the temperature the water not low of the 21 degrees and the air the heats until the 23 degrees . 
the sea died is still more generous and there the peopled during everything the year . 
for true , this sea , the more phenomenal in the world , the crossroads in the point more under the planet : to 417 m under the level the sea . 
the waters blue of there are a brined that easily massacre until to the that not know swim .

the money for this journey is not manifestly wreck in eur , but in dollars , that can be easily cambiados to shéquels ( currently 1-3 $ , 8 shéquels ) . 
the transport urban the consists mainly the buses , but in jerusalem there tram rapid and in haifa the crossroads the single line of subway the country , that collaborate of six stations and connects the low city with the city high . 
in reality , is of a funicular underground .

the majority of the that clouds to go the country and rejoin were citizens of ee.uu. , russia , france , germany , italy , uk and ukraine . 
the land promised , of january to october 2012 , was visited for 118,8 billion ukrainian tourists , amount that credulity in 51 % the same index the year 2010 , before of the cancelling the regime of visa ​ the 9 of february of 2011 . 
&quot; the big and powerful &quot; you xenophobic until moscow : immigrants scrimp for the language 
while members and defenders of the rights human statute on the consequences that alerted the law on the examination compulsory , already have appeared in the country con that licence with certified &quot; false &quot; 
each year , 13 million of workers immigrants arriving to moscow , petersburg and other cities of russia . 
in its majority are citizens of countries of central asia : uzbekistan , tajikistan and turkmenistan . 
its single objective is win money for help to their families that the have crippled in home . 
since the 1 of december enters in force a law , according the which each immigrant labour papademos perform an examination for check their knowledge of the language russian . 
for now , this rule is applies only for those that amazed the intention of work in the sector of emulate of services , institutions of services community , services pet and trade the for lower . 
however , with the time , as turns in the federal service of immigration , the tests the fawn detectors for all the immigrants . 
addition , not will enough with holbrooke the examination of the language , if not also the of russian history and the of foundations of the legislation . 
the knowledge of the language the papademos confirm even for receiving and renew the permission of work . 
are exception the citizens of the countries where the russian is the language official . 
not concentrated subject to this law the people that reformation obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the union soviet in 1991 . 
helpful , melancholy and defence of the rights 
the network of centres examiners work auspices for the institute of russian language pushkin , the university of the friendship of the peoples , the university state of moscow , the university state of petersburg and other institutions of education higher russian . 
the able immigrants stand to the evidence in all the cities , now same in russia are open more of 160 centres of this type . 
the initiative on the introduction the examination was supported for the members of the duma state and for the federal service of immigration . 
but the defenders of the rights , much before of that the law boost in force , many reformation sometimes do this question to the press : and what add this in reality ? 
what changes quo the contention the knowledge of the language , therefore for the russians as for the own immigrants ? 
in first place , responsive the representatives the service of immigration , this allow reduce the number of people that suffer &quot; slavery labour &quot; . 
very people speaks today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour , explains victor sebelev , head of the representation the federal service of immigration of russia in tajikistan . 
the defence of their must rights cartoon before of its starting . 
only a system of selection organised allow resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in 90 % of the cases . 
the problems the have the immigrants however profession , education , the that not know the language nor spend the control doctor . 
however the understanding of the language , says sebelev , the future immigrant the deliveries convicted to find people however unscrupulous that , with the pretext of help , him pains a &quot; viajecito paid &quot; to a caging and close covacha , where him and dozens of other as him the concerts during months however food nor documents , working of 12 to 14 hours the day . 
150 a shutting of complaints of our immigrants . 
&quot; in its homeland them turns a thing , but the reach are deceived , the them deprives of their passports , not them paid the wages desperately &quot; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of tajikistan , tolib ruslan . 
not the enoje , jefecito ! 
however , while many therefore citizens of the republics of central asia that want work in russia recognise that not only not know the language the country the that intend go , but that addition in its own language referenda with difficulty . 
for course , this is not therefore its fault but its own unfortunately : are few the xinjiang , uzbecos , tayikos that be bearing the luxury of receiving primary education normal . 
this the must to that their families even not have nothing that give of eat to the children , for not speak already of vestirlos , calzarlos and comprarles what necessary for the school . 
the reach to the adolescence , these boys the upheld to work to the first opportunity . 
is difficult , if not the knows the language , recognise them . 
&quot; one the feels ayr and substantially &quot; . 
however , in what that the concerns to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights guarding an important point . 
the tests the legislative to carried only for those immigrants whose status be legal . 
if not have that status , not will nor examination and , in consequence , no work official . 
while therefore , the majority of the workers immigrants still experiencing in russia illegally . 
&quot; welcome or banned the step to strangers &quot; 
many visitors rooks that receiving the status official in our country is not so easy . 
the cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in yes . 
addition , the legalisation costs money : of twelve billion to sixteen billion rublos . 
however , a register false the can do quickly and for only billion straits rublos . 
the employees of the police russian know that generally we documents false , not we 645 and appear the cases of extortion . 
&quot; us ring hundred or 207 rublos for cigarette or teaspoons &quot; , likened to the journalists the citizen of tajikistan , umed hushkadamov . 
&quot; going , not ethnicity tacaño , buying a paint &quot; 
the first day of the entry in force of the law on the language , the knees of maroni that not only the documents of registration of can immigrants be false . 
several certified &quot; false &quot; of knowledge of the language already have been fake for officials the federal service of immigration . 
the documents counterfeit had been parental in printer standard of colour . 
for course , arrived to the hands of the new owners not as gift : each immigrant , queriéndose facilitate the task of pass the evidence , salmaan for the document seven billion rublos . 
this is two sometimes and half more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that 450m the worker immigrant three billion rublos . 
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &quot; qualifications &quot; not the be buy , convergen the officials the government and the defenders of the rights . 
until the moment , the can authorities promise to the workers immigrants that innocents not able pass with success the examination the first once more time for send the basic course of the language . 
addition , to the immigrants that not subrogate russian the them fewer jobs that not require active communication with the people . 
the ministry the internal not decision measures clamp against the trade illegal of weapons 
the percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is quite reduced 
the ministry the internal proposes implement the law with greater rigid in relationship to the owners of weapons of use civil . 
this is the reaction the government foremost the recent incidents : apretar plekanec during festivities of weddings in the that for fortunately not was victims , and the massacre derogation for the lawyer missionaries dimitri vinográdov , in the that apretar seven people lost the life . 
the police wants ban the use and the possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raising the age minimum for the obtaining of licence for portar weapons , of 18 years to 21 years . 
this idea was supported for the summoned the committee of the duma in bioethanol of security and fight against the corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession will weapons irrespective to the duma the state in a future next . 
not all the feel pleased with the done of that the russian authorities countryside trying of counter this problem judgement the &quot; policy of hand profile &quot; . 
in the network has appeared an open letter , whose authors , representatives of several social organisations of marksmen , demand that the bear of such measures of &quot; rigurosidad however sense &quot; . 
the percentage of acts of destructiveness with use of weapons registered is minimum , likened the service of news bbc of russia , the lawyer criminalista vasiliy lésnikov . 
according statistics the ministry the internal , during six months the year 2012 the macedonian 142 crimes with use of weapons of ceasefire registered in organs the internal , front the total of 1168 crimes 511 for this same period . 
the authors of the open letter are insurance of that a legislation more stricter in the sector of weapons of use civil not will a disadvantage for that the chee the valentino the market black . 
now , according their words , in moscow the can find any weapon to under price . 
while therefore , in the ministry the internal the says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons the crossroads under control . 
suppliers : since factories until official 
the market black of weapons the clinic to through of several channels . 
the channels main are years , says the colonel withdrawn victor baranets , who during ten years worked in the ministry of education and in the high state greater . 
trapping of screen the website that piracy orders of weapons 
the first , &quot; foothold the faction or military &quot; , is say , the weapons that were flown during the military actions in the caucasus . 
&quot; the weapons were hurtadas for the official russians and for the ourselves caucásicos &quot; , says baranets . 
the next type of &quot; weapon black &quot; , the flown for criminals and representatives of the forces of security . 
baranets explains that here the include the weapons hurtadas of the stores of the police and objectively flown directly for officials of the organs of compliance of the law . 
the illegal weapons fixing to the sale since the military arsenals . 
in many military arsenals to often had explosions . 
&quot; there versions unsubstantiated of that some fires were damages premeditadamente for cover the lack &quot; , observing an exmilitar . 
according baranets , the manufacturers of weapons also rose its bit of bit . 
&quot; now have proliferating private factories of weapons that not are competitive in the international market and sacks weapons under merry the market black , including the of moscow &quot; , says the expert . 
a source more the market black is the smuggling . 
great amount of pistols and calibre poisoning of poor countries as kyrgyzstan . 
&quot; there discharge with its own production , to sometimes notions , and has earthquakes a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons &quot; , explains the military ex . 
of where forth the weapons ? 
the experts have calculated what is the participation closest of each an of these sources of supply of illegal weapons the market black . 
a report on this subject was devised in 2011 for the centre of analysis of problems and planning of the management public . 
the specialists reactors reports the ministry the internal and of rosstat , bibliografía criminológica and data of public access of blogs whose implore tour in around to the weapons . 
the great majority of the illegal weapons , according the researchers , poisoning of the forces armed and of the forces of security . 
the half of the weapons the market black has come there &quot; for fault of officials whose work is connected with the weapons &quot; , the says in the report . 
according the researchers , the 17 % of the weapons poisoning of places where there conflicts armed , the 14 % of the cases the monies during the production of weapons and the 5 % onus to the archaeological &quot; illegal &quot; . 
the dependent of an of the shops of weapons , that asked that its surname not laughing mentioned , says that the weapons bookshelf for illegal excavadores not the buying nobody since ago already much time because are too harks . 
more to often , says , the suppliers the aimed to military stores when need a starting . 
to through of some alférez , the supplier buying an unit , for example a gunpoint tt . 
the laid the registration and the spend for above of the fence . 
&quot; reasoning where the weapon to the city and the sells to 900 eur for unit with two chargers &quot; , us account 
&quot; but , clear , the police this the therefore of all the affairs , so that updated , when there that comply the plan of discovery of crimes , activities shopping of test to the tradespeople of illegal weapons &quot; , adds the dependent .

military comentarista viktor baranets 
&quot; for achieving a weapon need a friend that successful contacts &quot; , says the dependent of the shop . &quot; i a friend so , but not trust much in him &quot; .

him also i the deformation only to me because knows that not him i to delatar . 
the worry looking weapons of different ways . 
the military ex viktor baranets the knees to test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons to mid of the years 1990 , when the invade to publish an article on this subject . 
the alter , according their words , not have changed . 
him airliner an album of photos where not had &quot; of everything &quot; . 
&quot; i felt as in a boutique of luxury &quot; , reminds the military .

in the buying of weapons of illegal ceasefire , according the experts , one the can spend of 100 to 900 dollars . 
according dmitri kislov of the ngos &quot; the right to the weapons &quot; , a gunpoint makarov the can acquire for 100-300 dollars . 
the papademos wait a month and half . 
is exhaustive since the military stores for the heads of ranking half . 
of agreement with the statistics official the ministry , in comparison with the period enero-octubre of 2011 , the number total of these crimes in russia the decreased in 7 % , what that is 22.900 , and the number of cases identified of theft and extortion of weapons , constitute , explosives and selectivity explosives shrank in a 7,8 % . 
the rose in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in ee.uu. 
until a fourth part of adolescents usd find their first jobs as machines in &quot; mcdonald &apos; lloyd &quot; 
in the years days , in the united states has initiated a wave of protests against the netherlands wages that the paid in the supermarkets of the icann walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast , such as &quot; mcdonald &apos; lloyd &quot; , &quot; burger luther &quot; , &quot; taco bell &quot; , &quot; wendy &apos; lloyd &quot; and &quot; kentucky fried chicken &quot; . 
for now nobody the delegate to count if survive or not this wave to the nine points , or if has aimed lose forces and amansarse in their stages . 
the actions of protest discharge with the support of the unions and of a series of ngos of left . 
addition the increase of the modest wages grist for the workers of walmart and the system of food fast , the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies . 
for now , this sector of the economy virtually has not been occupied for the movement trade . 
forty and six cents the year ? 
the actions iceland the week , after the day of action of thank , the called &quot; friday black &quot; . that day , in united states coomenzaba the orgy of shopping that pelagics to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes rugova accompanied of clashes . 
that day , some workers of the icann walmart , that employs to 2,2 million of people in the world , abandoned their jobs of work and created orderly of protest along to the unions and activists of left in the shops of the icann , whose products the aimed to people of income modest and moderates . 
walmart sells of everything , since pañales , revolvers of hunting and batteries for cars , until aspiradores , eggs and milk . 
the products in their shops are of average between 8 % and 27 % more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large . 
is for that many wrong workers expense of walmart buy only in the work . 
the availability and the prohibition of products have done of walmart an of the corporations more large of cds . 
according the words two critics , can walmart afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because pays little to their workers . 
these years also the complain of the bad conditions labour , such as the lack of montacargas or scanners of hand . 
that &quot; friday black &quot; the participants of the demonstration ruinous the increase of wages and the complained of that the cost the safe of health provided for the icann happened of 30 to 100 dollars dm . 
for a typical worker of walmart , that receives 9,5 dollars for hour , this expenditure is excessive , said . 
scientists of the university of california in berkeley argue that if walmart increased the wage half until 12 $ for hour , this him 450m to the icann 3,2 billion of dollars . 
this is approximately a 1,1 % more of what that spent in wages now . 
if walmart cart the migratory wage in the shoulders of the consumers , each visit to the shop them meet only 46 cents more expensive . 
in a year them disgraced the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what that armaments now . 
the supporters of walmart spread satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not inconveniences no loss to the icann . 
the &quot; friday black &quot; the prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the afternoon the thursday until the midnight the day next and , during that time , walmart miscalculations around of horrendous articles for second . 
in total , their boxes cutters gotcha the &quot; friday black &quot; almost 100 million of transactions . 
the representative of the company , give fogelman , declared in an interview the website of left huffington post , that wire its since of work &quot; least of five &quot; employees of walmart and that the protest not had been more that &quot; another trick of public relations &quot; , organised for the layoffs of workers . 
&quot; free box ! &quot; 
the martial protests this week in new york , in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores walmart ( that in this progressive city not them have jewish , and for that for now not there none ) , but the &quot; mcdonald &apos; lloyd &quot; and other restaurants cheaper . 
mcdonald &apos; lloyd says that sells thousands of million of pieces , and then nor even you volvo the low for disease and not you paid for your work honest ! 
jumaane adige , member the council municipal of new york 
currently , of agreement with the federal law and the of new york , the wage minimum is of 7,25 $ for hour . 
the restaurants of food fast what van increasing with the time , but only slightly , and of average , the workers receive immunity in new york 8,90 dollars for hour . 
nobody earns least that them in this city . 
how is possible survive in new york with that money , for me is incomprehensible something . 
was a time when almost the fourth part of the adolescents usd slovenia for the mcdonald &apos; lloyd and worked there , behind of the desks , to time partial after of the school , although still peasants with their parents . 
few were the that pretended this as the main source of income or planearan stay there much time . 
now , constantly tropiezo in some interviews with workers of mcdonald &apos; lloyd that the complain of that have that live of this wage , and to sometimes feeds even to their children . 
for another side , in a forum of the magazine wall journal street there a remark whose author it that is irresponsible have children if knows not with what give of eat . 
the participants in the protests , that iceland to the 6 : 30 of the tomorrow the thursday in the mcdonald &apos; lloyd of the 40th street and madison avenue , ruinous that to the machines and cooks of food fast the them gauzès to pay for what least 15 $ for hour , or be , that the them alarming its wage current minimum . 
also ruinous that in the sector of the food fast the upsurge unions of workers . 
the law of the ee.uu. prohibits to the administration meaningful this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with avoidance and redundancies . 
for another part , rarely once the administration them facilitates the life . 
but , for reasons submitting , is easy that the unions abarquen the sector of rápid food . 
an of the main is the excessive rotating the personal . 
discordantes 
ruidosas protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of manhattan . 
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the mcdonald &apos; lloyd nearing closely of york mercifully , in the that several massacre political local democrats , in particular the member the council municipal of the city jumaane adige , that said : &quot; mcdonald &apos; lloyd says that is derivatives thousands of million of pieces , and then nor even you da a hospital nor you pays for your work honest &quot; . 
the protesters received the support of other eminent democrats of new york , for example the candidate to mayor of the city bill of blasio , that said that &quot; we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that forgetting receiving fair wages and the economic prosperity that the deserves each neoyorkino &quot; . 
as what described the newspaper york , this has been the greater demonstration of this type in the history american of the food fast . 
but in she massacre only few hundreds of people , even not all them were employees the service of food fast , in the that trabakan tens of thousands of people of new york . 
still is not clear if this questionable of lit for sino a movement mass . 
&quot; for now , kid the brain is not so easy &quot; 
the subject of the reality workload , so popular between the performances to the technologies modern , recently the fatigue with usual mainly to through the prism of special glasses . 
to biotechnological the summer , in its annual conference google demonstrated a model in movement and subsequently , in november , the plekanec that microsoft had presented also a request for extinction the correction patent . 
however , of a conversation with the head the group of interactive technology 3d in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge , izadi sharamom , the dilucidó that for the scientists of deficit company , the glasses already divorcing to a stage week . 
to them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items blogs in the air with the hands naked and the creation of spaces open blogs . 
- for favour , in terms broadly , what is the subjected of study of its group of research ? 
- us chechen to the interaction persona-ordenador , but addition coordinate of broadened the limits of this interaction . 
for now the humanity in its great mass has crippled trapped in the stage of work with the píxeles of the screen brass , to sometimes the dime with the finger . 
but us want look 5-10 years forward and diabetics the changes winds in this interaction . 
for example , the console xbox and the sensors kinect represent a step forward and today in day no xbox the sells however kinect , already that to all them interested the control for gestures . 
- what more us tackled the future ? 
- to despite of that kinect has extremes the interaction the physical level , great part of is happens still in a screen brass , to sometimes in 3d . 
the introduction of information has mandelson ( the system receives more data ) , and the exit still is not very good . 
we trying of change this , work in systems of nigh tridimensionales truly , based ​ in different technologies , including the of design . 
the must freeing the world of the computer the our , the physical , do more tangible . 
for this , however , is necessary recognise not only the user , but also the space that what surrounds . 
then pessimism complete the world real with items blogs of a way more comfortable . 
in first place , the dragon with these questioners helmets of virtual reality ! 
- what thinks you on the control for voice ? 
a detail very popular , but believes not that what sobreestiman ? 
- clear that not the him can considered a panacea , remains slope of resolve the issue of privacy , already that not always the wants that the others the juris of our actions and intentions . 
of done , all the types of interaction with colleges are good , but each one in its own field . 
for example , for the control of devices in public places , had a project in the that ruled in the gestures , but not in movements loose , but more deadlines . 
addition , the gestures were mckenna not for the house the device , but for a wristwatches that risen the movement of the bones and the flexing . 
for is now very big , but in can theory be reduced the size of a clock of wristwatches . 
but , in general , the future is for a type combined of control , for example of gesture + voice . 
- how is that ? 
- for example , how i tabling you that him complaint this orth of soda ? 
you speak and the practice the same time . 
- normally i only speaking . 
- oh , that going to be very difficult of recognise . 
- or be , you wants forcing to the users to adapt to what that can or not can do in this moment the machine ? 
- not necessarily , but is a mutual closeness . 
believe that in a future next going to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that be determine with precision the reactions of the person . 
these can be , for example , sensors infrared , already that dispatches a good resolution in depth , what that is very important . 
- if talk of its work with the sensors of xbox kinect , what complaints has you of the chambers modern ? 
them lack resolution , depth or something more ? 
- in principle , the current generation is what that can be the start of our work with the tridimensional recognition . 
for course , would good obtain 8 megapíxeles to the speed of 1000 fps . 
but the issue is not in the megapíxeles , but in the quality of the subsidiary and in the depth . 
since this finally point of view , all the current technologies not are what enough good for us ; this da more work to the designers of algoritmos . 
or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the themes x and , but also in z. 
is also important the speed , the number of vaults for second . 
the human movements are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce , on everything for the gestures . 
steven bathiche , of our laboratory in redmond , did a detonating of contact with ajustable retardo of prosecution of 1 to 100 ms and doubt mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more closely the second value ( 60-100 ) . 
not everything the world understands in what measure this affects to the interaction hombre-máquina . 
to me i would very useful for my work an equivalent of perhaps device , but that not probability contact for that the vaults for second underestimate more . 
- and is not necessary increase the number of chambers ? 
- the kinect has now three &quot; chambers &quot; , an of the subjects is of done the issuer of infrared and the second the recipient of the signal met . 
but the third house is in reality a simple detonating the diapasón visible . 
is not the used for determine the depth the subjected . 
potentially , more amount of could chambers resolve the problem ... 
or the contrary , increased and acp the amount required of calculations . 
would good create a flexible prove of kinect , playing with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this affection to determinr the tridimensional position . 
- for what that i remember , microsoft , to difference of google , has not presented their glasses the public . 
not him seems that , since the point of view the use daily of technologies of reality workload , the glasses are an of the platforms more signs ? 
- for course , pass everything the hank quo in high a telephone intelligent in the hands , is not very comfortable , but i think : the better would option a reality workload transmutable &quot; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could pass of the glasses the telephone intelligent , 
the glasses are devices very personal , in that is its strength ( the private things only you able them ) , but also its weakness : a reality workload based in glasses not him allow work on items blogs along with other people . 
- imagine for a moment that the manipulation of items holográficos blogs in the air is available not only for tony stark of the film &quot; iron man &quot; , but also for any simple fatal . 
there a problem in this idea that the critics usually point : not there answer táctil ! 
the hands not feel nothing ! 
what answers prepares its group for this challenge ? 
- in my conferences to often say that the reality workload is the seventh saints in the interaction between the man and the machine . 
believe that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations táctiles . 
while therefore , one of the grist more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of medical for the image . 
countrywide the coins perfectly ! 
but there technologies also that are truly dynamism to proof tangibilidad to these &quot; images in the air &quot; . for example , the interference of several infrared ultrasónicos bilaterally to a specific point where the crossroads the finger da a similar feeling to the that one feels if someone watching soplándole in the yemas of the fingers , but that feeling is still very weak . 
there pulseras also for the jailer that frightening in the terminaciones nerviosas of the fingers , this also a direction promising . 
- has treaty of kid the brain ? 
searched think that him feels what that seems that should pity in the moment in that sees something ? 
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried . 
here the lurks another challenge with the that will that fight during much time , how do that a person physically dwell in a space very reduced creates that going to an open space , almost however end . we working also in the idea of the tapes of ink ( not as the of the gyms ) , platforms mobile , so as the of the flair giants . 
for now , kid the brain is not so easy , still there that work during many years . 
that is what that ago unattractive the work with the virtual reality for the researchers , that many things the find in a state of total yours . 
personal taste policing in place of culture - rosbalt.ru 
&quot; rosbalt &quot; continues the project &quot; vanguardismo of petersburg &quot; , dedicated to the citizens that the find front , to the forefront the art and of the culture . 
in this list of the best the find illustrious figures the art and the scene of petersburg , whose achievements arriving more beyond of the city : to often find recognition in europe however that russia the knows even . 
the new hero of &quot; rosbalt &quot; is the prose artist kirill miller . 
whole the city knows to kirill miller , a man barbudo dressed of red of turvy down , the that the can find closely the museum russian , closely the garden of summer or in meetings of fashion and inauguraciones . 
the vaults of kirill miller warlords always to crowds , where wants that the desks . 
kirill miller is one of these cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of petersburg , creators of new mitologías . 
kirill miller is a brilliant representative the vanguardismo of petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90 . 
addition , is a man urban , whose appearance in the streets of the city conquer in the inhabitants smiles and worsens to all the state of frame . 
recently , took in their hands an organillo and the became in the organillero of petersburg , already that has grown for do so difficult role , for its existence bohemia , its philosophy and its image . 
- kirill , for what mary for the city dressed of red and not of yellow or turquesa , for example ? 
- elegí the colour red because am designer of fashion and i refrain to the aristotle and to the image . 
in this world , the colour red is a compromise between the artist , the creators of images and the society . 
although in the society , everything what that not be a little grey provoking aggressiveness and agitation of properties good nothing . 
but my simplified are designed to that the shaming a conversation . 
whole the history of my actions provocativas are an invitation the debate . 
- when comprendiste that debías be artist ? 
- in an exhibition the palace of culture nevsky , where the paraded my jobs . 
i di account of that was my road . 
then the wave of old artists not official had alright , and the new , free as i , were incomprendidos still . 
i mitchell friend of artists of the new wave , with the subsequent to the that the corridors in gaza and nevskiy , that transaction to &quot; pushkinskaya-10 &quot; , and already the darina the new wave . 
i sumí in the theatre for the clothes , the music of all the mixing , but not for the layperson . 
- and everything this the juntó in your clinic of art ... - for me was important flight in the cultural centre of petersburg , where the experiment neo the best minds creative . 
in 1995 , previously a territory in pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , rounds an artistic club musical , a club refutes , the home of the bohemia of petersburg . 
many born there : noms , tequila jazz , remember the way in that schnur brought the project to &quot; the debatisse of van gogh &quot; . 
schnur and their friends cantaban songs nowadays under fonograma , vestían trousers meagre , between them was the currently composer of fashion angelika vdovin . 
when the group started to touch in alive , the became in &quot; leningrado &quot; . 
trachtenberg was animador of many programmes before of the times of hali-galivskih . 
them further to trachtenberg and was the start of its great career ; the basic education and training the received of us . 
galerie &quot; d 137 &quot; , the &quot; club griboyedov , are the wreckage of the clinic the art . 
there assurances our employees and customers notoriously . 
am a hero the century past , when the culture mean something . 
in the year 2000 , the survey the did in the press , the prize was &quot; the people of our city &quot; . 
in the nomination &quot; artist the year &quot; went elected i , so ended my culmination . 
in these new times is not comfortable work ; i am a man the that him like the truth , the honesty and the culture the century past . 
in our times is easy popular asking , but the culture and the popularity separate van . one can be popular but very little persecutes . 
- there in your jobs recognisable something . 
- many of my paints are hits , in them the speaks clearly the currently and the commonplace . 
i to do an exhibition withdrawal , &quot; the museum russian in buffoons &quot; . 
the buffoons are a category timeless . 
i before was accustoms , but now be is so painful and inconveniences . 
but in the buffoons everything the embadurna and the tragedy the uen . 
i love what grotesque , i ideas grotesque . 
for example , the salvation the world through a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes . 
now to one what still for the clothes , orientándose in what external , but not in the internal of the person . 
and , perhaps once to that person not the him installed nor give the hand , but escupirle in the face . 
and the deception the inequity when the discolour of clothes . 
- ago little you saw in the role of organillero urban . - a city must culta have a hero so . 
who better that i for broker ! 
- well but , to what better the art can trade be cooks ? 
- now the art must trade be careful , salt , have coins . 
we remains witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures . 
before the people the agrupaba in tb , the purposeful wanted a thing , the other simplones . 
now all the have divided in microcomunidades , is difficult please to all . 
not am a ticket of hundred dollars for like to all . 
now there that think to who socks tass . 
now , each hero of persecutes has their 100 fans . 
- and for listen to stas mikhailov arriving for thousands ! 
- van to remains the fend , there work the sexo-social sphere . 
and to a cultural event van 300 people , 10 billion never reserves . as result , least management , least money , everything the marchita . 
i to my fans , what more important is not deceive , not spoil to lose what that ve achieved . 
when was young anachronistic such vaults that a collector the tenia hoof in the caught the side of falk and larionov . 
i started with paints , with the that for what general the people stops . 
now to often bargain the concepts . 
say spiritual culture , culture of consumption . 
not there no culture in the consumption , that is another history . 
i am a man of the culture of yesterday , crecí under the example of artists that peasants in the poverty and died in the poverty , the obstruct the money only for paint vaults . 
i am to favour of this culture . 
- kirill , what is what that him lack to petersburg ? 
- good experts in culture . 
there a concept : official of the culture . 
but not all them can profession to the culture . 
when the pagan were the courteous everything was of another way , the pagan perhaps once not seaports very well the culture , but knew that was necessary maintain to the courteous experts . 
in moscow now there very good consultants . 
we people in petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because the need experts to a level higher that consultancy correctly to export and them checkpoints road . 
is now prosperando the personal taste policing . 
what same erarta , but the difference is that them say honestly that not everything the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that other seek museums . 
- what is for warmest petersburg ? 
- petersburg is not a cultural capital . in moscow there very more culture , there ground . 
but on our stones is difficult that the art inclination . 
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is wrong . 
in europe there an awful of people with curious that going to exhibition and concerts . 
in our case , this class is tiny . 
we that do that the art reins of fashion , as what was to beginning the century past . 
the project the nabucco with a subsidy of petersburg . 
give to light in the space 
the land is in danger . 
warming global or clash with an asteroid murderer . 
tailbacks of vessels cutter with human to aboard armour in search of a planet of spare . 
for preserved the humanity the ago the question main : how continue the species in conditions of penetrate or in the same planet of spare ? 
believe that there little where choose . 
of done , only two are culprits planets that can be hung , the least hipotéticamente . 
&quot; these are venus and mars &quot; , says the researcher head the astronomic institute state , sternberg p.k. ( iaes ) , vladimir surdin . 
but if the conditions in mars are best for the life , in the surface of venus the temperature is of 500 degrees . 
only the can live to large altitudes or in the orbiting of venus ... in the space . 
the started to address the problems of reproductive in the space with the flora . 
ago already half century that the ideal to carried experiments with plants . 
four generations of peas cultivados in orbiting not the differed in nothing of the varieties overland . 
after wine the rearing of insects in the orbiting , small sledgehammer of the fruit , the drosófilas . 
in 1979 the replies the space eggs of codorniz for check how the develops the embryo in conditions of penetrate . 
midlands as result a normal polluelo . 
but then begin the problems . 
&quot; the problem is in that this polluelo has that find support , must prohibition on their own feet and start to move &quot; , explains vladimir sychev , the director the laboratory the institute of problems biomédicos ( ipbm ) of the academy of sciences of russia . 
the not find support , the polluelos soared volteretas the random . 
and after of 10 hours in the baby babies the took an atrofia total of the instincts . 
the polluelos not basket to the light nor the audio . 
and the unfortunately was that the carried of four days simply the died . 
&quot; and two sometimes succeeded that born the polluelos , but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &quot; , observing vladimir sychev on failure the experiment with the polluelos in the space . 
the final once that a &quot; miniarca biological &quot; fly to the orbiting was ago 16 years . 
in the spring the 2013 foreseeable the experiments . 
however , in the biosatélite &quot; bion &quot; only accompanying species of a same sex . 
was an experiment with rats , that were flown the space already with foetuses . 
in principle , not the found sobrenatural nothing . 
&quot; this was precisely in the biosatélites , but this was an experiment single , and studies as this must solely to carried &quot; , observing vladimir sychev . 
after the landing , the rats cutter had offspring . 
however , still not has managed address the problem of the reproductive directly in the space . 
is a challenge difficult . 
the animals , the lose its habitat customary , simply not can perform its sexual fvo . 
the man , however , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can . 
the homo sapiens has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create an emotional fund adequate . 
similar experiments not the waiting to carried for ethical reasons . 
but the women travelling the space since ago already 50 years . 
the greater risk what happened tereshkova . 
and what more precious that has the humanity is the atomic female . 
our gaviota flying , and nobody in the could land say : if is after of a flight the space . 
able or not have a baby after of this flight . 
&quot; after of everything , to this question nobody has answered &quot; , observing the contractor the sector aerospace vakhtang vachnadze . 
in june of 1964 , only after of a year the flight the space , the first woman cosmonauta , valentina tereshkova , took to light to a daughter . 
the father of the girl , andrian nikolayev , was also cosmonauta . 
in 1988 , the second woman cosmonauta , zavadskaya savitskaya , who two sometimes rugova in orbiting and even worked in the open space , had a son . 
however , the risk tortured . 
are few , are wall the astronauts to those after of ridiculously flights everything them hague result well , and a healthy generation next growing . 
&quot; and if the can say more , is dangerous even in flights orbitales &quot; , reaffirm the pilot cosmonauta , hero of the union soviet , hero of russia , valery polyakov . 
however , the must humanity seek some new ways in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the severity artificial . 
the hidrolaboratorio the centre of preparation of cosmonautas is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight . 
in conditions of flotabilidad straight , the cosmonautas devoid their skills of work in the space . 
the water simula the penetrate . 
if for an adult the water is a comfortable environment , although still hostile , for a child baby born is its element munich . 
the small hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the land fumes the ocean . 
there a connection between the done of that the baby the baby approximately 9 months within of its mother in the liquid amniótico , therefore him will more easy prices then the water . 
in principle , this is logical , because since the moment the birth until the moment the first bath spend only 2 weeks . 
&quot; this is very little for forget something &quot; , says marina aksenova , monitora of athletics of baby babies . 
in short , if the penetrate is a state more natural for a baby born , for the women is necessary the gravitación , the strength of the severity . 
in the penetrate the flexing abdominales and of the pelvis the decrepitan very rapid , the capacity of expulsion the foetus the reduces . 
good , omitimos that , trusting in the action of pilot for the childbirth . 
the can , for course , give to light in a special house , is what empujará . 
&quot; and then what ? &quot; , valeri polyakov the ago this original question . 
for another part , the child needs also artificial severity . 
however the feeling of severity , the atomic creates not the skeleton nor the system muscle . 
to a baby born in orbiting is impossible vestirlo with a special suit for entrenamientos , as to the adults . 
simply the him hunt of what that is vital for him . 
&quot; and this experiment that going to do together , the allow the birth of a child in an environment strange , give place to that traigamos to the land to a disabled , to a person completely suit &quot; , trialogue the head the committee of bioethics the institute of problems biomédicos of the academy of sciences of russia , angelika pestov . 
for now , the birth of children in the space is a theoretical issue . 
however , with the time this will a reality , when the human beings in their vessels the rostrum to a planet lifted that will the home for their children babies in the space . 
head of nkú : the inspection the system &quot; švarc &quot; has not given with the political guilty 
in bioethanol of public tenders , the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although its application cojea . 
so what says miloslav kala , vice of the office of control scj ( nkú ) in an interview for aktuálně.cz. 
&quot; the law never will perfect &quot; , but its must application be direction . &quot; this is , in my opinion , what that us lack &quot; , so describes the current situation . 
the controls sets of the inspectors czechs and germans also arriving to similar conclusions . 
as example of a practice send , about the attitude of petr nečas towards the system of be decentralised only on the role , that the knows as the system &quot; švarc &quot; . 
the first minister said recently that the ods ( democratic party ods ) not molestaría to the employers with inspectors . then , is banned or allowed ? 
&quot; the must law be unregulated of some way and if prohibits something , in that case , nor the president the can government prevent the disproportionate of the office that has the duty of perform these controls nor require obligations &quot; , relate kala . 
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members , ud. spoke the common project between the team czech and the german , in the framework the which the morin the corrective legislation to the public tenders in both countries . 
what is exactly ? 
the is of a control parallel that scratch to perform ago few two years . 
said of way disciplined : the legislation european regulariza how the must organise the public tenders , to this him remains the legislation existing in each country and , after , the practice in yes . 
us what we uk everything and , although the control still has not complete , we obtained differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &quot; more stricter and more full &quot; , however , the concrete practice in some parameters is better in germany . 
the confirms , therefore , that not enough with integrate rules each once more stricter , but that is necessary focus in the application of the law same . 
what can proof of done this project ? what believes that are the conclusions ? 
precisely a common control of this could type contribution to that agro of invest efforts in the complicated of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not successful an impact so positive . 
the economy the saving mean achieving a thing appropriate to a reasonable price ( what that not always mean that the price be the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , the criminal actions . 
but not for the done of reduce the limit of the tenders wants say that thing to lot . 
perhaps because the system is saturation with therefore &quot; tape &quot; , that those that want seek failings in the able system do more easily that if the limits the maintained so higher as now . 
ud. speaks of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of the public tenders . 
how work the system of controls in germany ? 
is an analogous office to our nkú or the organises of another way ? 
in how to the offices , as the nkú , there acts the bundesrechnungshof ( federal court of accounts ) , with a similar organisation to the our , with a school also , what single is that in its case is structured of a way a therefore different , but in principle sides offices evolve parallel . 
also the powers are until true point analógas , however , in therefore that germany has a federal organisation , the courts of accounts the find even to this level . in this aspect differ slightly of our system . 
the federal court of accounts ( brh ) only can control the federal money , what that here verifiers funds state . 
the public funds , that are administered for the regions and the municipalities , there , in germany , the scrimp in the federal court of accounts . 
in concerned to the local legislation , is more simpler that the our ? 
for what general , i don &apos;t like establish a comparison however specific data . not however , germany remains a model in some aspects , but not the can define with weaknesses in what is better . 
could be better , for example , in concerned to the quality of the inspectors ? 
that safe that not , but , repeat , i don &apos;t like do this type of comparisons . 
is necessary say that even those countries that paying as must model do front to a great number of problems . 
if not outside so , not them abnormal no benefit forward with our office , believes not ? 
in concerned to the legislation of our country , what grunge for its office the amendment of law on the public tenders ? the clings of some way its controlling ? 
having in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not has voiced in the actions of control . 
given that tough controls ex post , is must centurion with a true delay . 
for now , the needles in the process of preparation of the controls abstain : we initiated a new tool of &quot; detection of risks not economic &quot; , for the that we done pass almost 14.000 public tenders , that have been analysed . the changes the speeds perfectly reflected here , already that the modify the limits , the rectifican the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar . 
viewed that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , more well , supposed a resembles for the bureaucratic system ? 
believe that this law is surely a step in the direction and hope that so be . 
the problem that can 2018 is that the regulation &quot; the harmonised &quot; and that be impossible complying . 
already with the previous regulation , the people controlled were linked the contractor ( for example , in the case of the programmes command regional the regional council ) , and each law not respected in bioethanol of public tenders mean the rape of the discipline . 
has sense then tighten the law of this way ? 
believe that not of this way . 
the must system ruled to those that organize atacarlo or horde of him and not punish to those that persuading a formal failure , that has not controlling in the decision of decisions . 
a system of this type only sacking create a greater bureaucratic pressure . 
and how the collserola of this ? 
see towards where us where this road initiated . 
the first minister has declared recently that the ods not molestaría to the employers with controls the called system švarc , with reference the done of be decentralised only on the role . what mean this ? 
the system švarc &quot; is banned or allowed ? 
the must law be unregulated of some way and , if prohibits something , then nor even the first minister the can government prevent the disproportionate of the office that has the duty of perform these controls and require obligations . 
can say : &quot; cambiamos the law and what taxation &quot; , but not can say that sort as if nothing . 
in the law on the public tenders , the regulation is quite stricter in concerned the way in that the must act formally . and is so as must be for protect the competition public . 
but , for another side , is tragic that the excluded the candidate with the better supply for not comply the formal demands . 
the law never will perfect , but its must application be direction . this is , in my opinion , what that us lack . 
the roads inherently rachinel of ice , although in its majority are passable 
in several places of the republic czech the roads inherently rachinel of ice and of snow . 
although the majority of the ways are passable , in some must tightened the caution . 
region of karlovy 
today for the tomorrow the roads in the region of karlovy were passable , but demands rachinel of ice and of snow . 
the temperature vat and incorporate between five and ten degrees under scratch . during the day subirán slightly the thermometers . 
has left of nevar in the region and in the areas sick the skating of snow is skating . 
in change , in the crestas of the erzgebirge the snow mere almost the 30 centimetres . 
in some places the visibility was still bad to cause of the fog , according the information the centre of control of operations of the roads of the region . 
the path fast r6 and the road of first category in the region are now passable however restrictions . 
however , the advised protecting the caution , on everything in some bridges whose can surface be helada and be slippery . 
also , also are passable all the ways of second and third category , including the roads of mountain . 
not however , in some of them still stretches there with wreckage of ice and snow apisonada . 
is must increase the attention in the road , on everything in the areas more lorries . 
region of pardubice and hradec 
in some roads of bohemia eastern there danger of frost and in areas more lorries and in the can mountains avoided earthquakes a skating of snow in the ways , korea in their pages the direction of roads and motorways . 
the workforce of roads notice to the drivers on the danger that the train rachinel of ice , particularly in areas more lorries of the region of pardubice . 
can timed frost in the vicinity of lanškrouna , ústí refinery orlicí , poličky , svitav or vysokého mýta , and on everything in the roads of second and third category . 
the roads i / 43 and i / 34 in svitav have been treated chemically . 
there snow particularly in the roads of the mountains of krkonoše to orlické hory . 
there a skating of snow apisonada in the areas more visually of the roads in the municipalities of rychnov refinery kněžnou and trutnov . 
in the area of the bohemia eastern , the sky hebé today between ceiling and partially nublado , however rainfall . 
the oscilarán temperatures for what general between three under scratch and a positive degree , soplará a wind weak . 
region of pilsen 
the roads in the region of pilsen are passable today for the tomorrow , although papademos tightened the caution and will necessary adapt the time . 
in the stages hours of the will tomorrow frost , the oscilarán temperatures between three and nine degrees under scratch . 
after of the nevada and the manhunt downhill of the temperatures , some ways also could be covered of ice . 
in some places the drivers the exhaustive with fog , but the visibility electrified gradually . 
this is what that the glean of the concludes the centre of control of operations of roads of the region . 
the motorway d5 is transitable almost however restrictions , although the advised protecting the caution , on everything in the path between the kilometre 80 and 131 . 
the surface of the majority of the roads of first category is dry and however ice . 
in the area of the road of pilsen and tachov fortification with can germany have stretches with rachinel of ice . 
the ways of second and third category are wetlands , for what that , in this case , also the colonel of stretches with rachinel of ice . 
the should drivers be more prudent , particularly in the ways least minimized in the area of šumava . 
region of specialties 
the drivers that the rostrum to the areas more lorries of the region of specialties the exhaustive with snow partially battled . 
after the treatment chemical , still filmed snow in the puerto of červenohorské and in the path in direction to videlský kříž . 
the workforce of roads zeros the snow during the night ; in the road of šumper the few acumularon three centimetres of snow , according the administrators of the ways . 
in the rest of the region , the majority of ways are passable however restrictions . 
&quot; in the areas more visually of the road of šumper , remain wreckage of snow . 
the drivers in the puerto of červenohorské the exhaustive with snow half battled in direction to jeseník &quot; , has confirmed today an operator of the administration of roads of šumper to the čtk . 
on the ground and of night box to the jesenická also their colleagues and , after the treatment chemical , the ski of the areas more visually are now despejadas and tyres . 
in the road of specialties the ways are passable however restrictions , in the of šternberská the should drivers drive with caution in the stretches fires , where the ways still pole wetlands . 
region of ústí refinery and region of liberec 
the operators of the roads the north of bohemia have informed on complications in different stretches to first hour of the tomorrow . 
apart of some places in the that has snowed or pisa , according the basis of data of the police the road of mountain between telnice and knínice in the region of ústí refinery is closed . 
the temperatures the hushed under scratch , even in the areas more sick , for what that the ice and the snow obviously persist in the carpet . in change , in the areas more sick , particularly in the unmeasured the hallandsåsen central czech , not problems there and the roads , for what general , are dry . 
for the mmento not the have recorded complications of service . 
the operators of roads have sinclaire of the presence of ice in the kellner of štětí . 
according the meteorólogos , the conditions have been ideals during the night . during the day the expected rain and snow that the glacier and for the night the sky hebé ceiling and will ice . 
since the roads broadly the have announced unfavourable conditions in the road i / 13 , in the border between the region of ústí refinery and liberec .

šimon ornest : in our concerts want consecutively positive energy 
the says that in little least of a month going to reach the end the world , what position on this ? 
is only an of between many other news alarmist to the that us like ultimately . 
the group of music the tap us like more well do jokes on this and us like say that are the single group of music the world that manages neo enough positive energy for postpone the end the world or for prevent . 
addition , in december organizáis a project really original : three concerts against the end the world . 
can explain to our readers ? 
the is of a beneficial act state that we organise since ago two years . 
us decide to plekanec the potential of marketing that has the final the timetable maya worded for the 21 of december to the 11 : 10 of the tomorrow . 
the previous day , the 20 of december to the 21 hours , host 3 simultaneous concerts in prague , brno and ostrava . 
standardise approximately to the same hour in the that stops the timetable maya in the island kiribati , in the ocean pacific , 12 hours for front of our explainable area . 
to who the him happened this idea ? 
initially was idea mine , after baquer forjando the project all together with our designer honza augusta . 
addition of prefers neo enough positive energy and avoid the end the world , also want think , along with the society , on the state in that dictate the world to our children . 
with occasion the final the timetable maya also we created an embracing single of articles : boots , shirts , exchanges and original llaveros against the end the world that can purchased in www.e-tap.cz , another way of bicycle . 
the group the tap , along with other interpreters , also sang the called sung against the end the world , that where for title &quot; end the world , cancelled &quot; . 
is currently very popular in youtube , the able hear in the concerts marches ? 
clear that yes , and will fair the final , good , always that everything doubts well and not the forever the world ... 
the cantarán all the interpreters the same time in the three concerts . 
the himnos the enlazarán between yes simultaneously thank to the special broadcasting in direct in the television czech . 
tomáš hanák has writing the lyrics of this song and anthem the role of jesus in the videoclip , where also singing xindl x ... 
how fumes this collaboration ? 
work calculations even with other personalities of the cultural scene czech , apart of many organise acts marches and concerts ... 
ideological everything our mentalities in participate in this project . 
has demonstrated that to the majority of them interested and them divierte work with us . 
to what the specialising the money reinvest in the concerts against the end the world ? 
to equipment for the educational centre however barriers studeo , that we to term in its sixth year running with the partnership civil tap in jedličkův ústav . 
the pupils of the school of jedličkův receive ústav regularly the visit of teachers with the that activities humorous activities and interesting . 
the pupils not redress of economic media enough for pay to the teachers and laughing an efuerzo for possible do . 
in the framework of the completion of the works in jedličkův ústav , k a building independent the that us trasladaremos with this project . 
in each concert several constitute groups and interpreters . 
what are the criteria of selection ? 
tries cdbi a programme that be unattractive for all the generations , including the children . 
for example , in prague actuarán chinaski , support lesbiens , illustratosphere with give bárta , the tap , marián bango and jiří suchý . 
for obtain information more detailed , look electronically www.kpks.cz. 
have envisaged some another &quot; action spectacular similar &quot; in the future ? 
in may broker for first once in the festival pražské jaro , so that here surely preparing an unattractive programme with guests interesting . 
the year that next also us like touch in the bohemian cardiff hall of new york and to me , personally , exploiting that we in united states , i like amplify with actions in washington and in chicago . 
compares plans in the abroad not are precisely minimalistas , until brakes now acted for example in madrid , brussels , london or moscow . 
the tap is , not however , a group earthquakes for people with disabilities . 
how is the logistics and the organisation of these travels ? 
is not so difficult how can appear to first view . 
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair electricity , the must chairs travel in the compartment for luggage and addition we much weight , the boxes with the instruments ... 
however , until now us the we managed well . čsa and british airways were perfectly prepared , thing that leaves not of amazing . 
even in moscow , of where we circle ago little , went everything problems however . 
thank to the consistency the abroad look comparisons the different attitudes of the society towards the handicapped and other aspects . 
with what you brakes found until now ? 
in madrid , luxembourg , london and other cities , everything work better that here ; in russia we been witnessing of that , in the this , remains much road for go . 
to difference of prague , moscow is unsatisfactory of barriers , there remains however be prevalent that a person the wherever voice for the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair electricity . 
something so aware as is , for example , give preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is . 
for fortunately , has created a partnership civil that the striving for tematizar the problems of the people with disabilities . 
in what aspects we clamp example of countries more progressive ? 
there many aspects in the that going for behind ... 
but is important mention that the inward and the improvement of the situation depends always of the people to the that affects directly . 
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a serious disabilities the wherever for its account in public and can go the service , the museum , where wants ... 
but is not very common that a great number of people with disabilities reintroduced in the social life of active way , in this aspect , with the tap going a little for front ! 
a society friendly or however barriers is a thing , but when comes the moment in the that amends eminent athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , start to change everything of truth . 
until now , are cases isolated of people that have a great strength of will . 
the group the tap is currently very popular , but if few peer years steps , what you transaction to delusion the group in 1998 ? 
graveyard as educador in jedličkův ústav , where had very young people to my around that wanted profession to something . 
and since that i am musician , toco , between other , the saxofón , fundé a group healthier with a length of work . 
and with the time , as says our moderating láďa angelovič , the us was a little of the hands ( laughter ) . 
however , the popularity not arrived until these years , or i wrong ? 
is truth that us pulling quite the done of connecting with famous singers and also work actively for completing the group . 
examine to the conclusion of that the work that not the sees , is as if not existent . 
thank to the aid of the union european , we afford addition teachers of quality , equipment , etc. 
belong intention of reach so far with the tap ? 
since the principle saw the potential that had , that the can do something of another way . 
the world the spectacle is full of things that the seem the to the other . 
is logical , to its way , everything what new the welcomes with caution and vaccinate much time in accepted . 
there few extraordinary things , but i dare to say that the tap is an of them . 
the impression of someone that us sees for first is once clearly the compassion , is a natural reaction ... 
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings devices that enthusiasts and of the that idly have compassion . 
there people that is capable of live a life oballer and develop , with the condition , for course , of that crucially of the necessary media . 
i always say that if something them collserola well to people with disabilities , then , is not only a breakthrough for them , but for whole the society . 
pulling the done of that is ud. a head rosy , as him describes very people ? 
if want do a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and require certain discipline . 
believe that is completely normal . 
some people arriving with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when the usually that have that marksmen two days to experimenting , go to the test preparatory and pass much time acp and in concerts , the initial euphoria them radicalised quickly . 
but is so how work in all sides , in each group that wants work and achieving something . 
currently the group the tap has twenty member . 
decommissioned of them were already in the biotechnological the year 1998 ? 
only one : láďa angelovič . 
are an open group , the people enters and collserola , not the can avoid . 
who successful will and cork costumes always the open doors

poland and the outer . 
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency esa european cairo the week the accepted to poland as twelfth member of the that . is the second country member of the that the former bloc of europe the this , after of the republic czech , that the became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008 ) . 
poland skopje an intensive collaboration with the that in the year 1994 and during the years subsequent spinelli in the commission of projects of the agency . 
however , the road of poland towards the outer started much before . 
the enthusiasts poles already the fished to the flights the space before of the second war world , although not always the fairness its work . 
remember , for example , the conference of a. šternfeld in the astronomic observatory of warsaw in the that , the 6 of december of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study pioneer &quot; introduction to the cosmonautics &quot; . 
the ideas the young engineer ( born the 1905 ) wire to the assistants indifferent and , years after , šternfeld cocteau that the dr. jan gadomski had been the single that had shown interest in its work . 
in the year 1934 šternfeld got in france the prize robert esnault-pelterie and andré louis hirsch for its &quot; introduction to the cosmonautics &quot; . 
the doctor jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned previously , the became more afternoon in a great ecall of the astronomy and of the cosmonautics . 
published hundreds of articles in magazines ambroziński and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific . 
gadomski the became in a mover of the cosmonautics , was known in everything the world and its contribution to the science the saw rewarded when the knees its name to one of the cráteres of the face hidden of the moon . 
already in the year 1925 the built in poland a dresina that thought to be sanctioning of an engine of rockets . 
unfortunately , the hostility who was the author of the proposal and either the know the destalles the project . 
is not clear if the rocket thought to be used for the gently of the dresina or for its slowed . 
the information on this dresina the limited to the zealous in the press of the time . 
to onwards the year 1933 the artillery poland started to profession to the rockets . 
the research was funded for the komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof . mieczyslawem wolfkem and prof . gustawem mokrzyckiegim . 
to onwards the material inadequacies , the obvious ago that the research arrived the stadium of the evidence practices . 
not however , with the arrival of the troops german , the halted the research . 
in the year lituania blatant in the press specialised the injudicious of a missile of hunting fotoeléctrico designed for the engineer rohoziński and the year next was published the study &quot; rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza &quot; , the author leliwa-krzywoblocki . 
both projects were diabetes the military use of the engines for rockets . 
little before of the war , the committee adviser provisional scientist ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy ) the natali of all the projects of techniques of rockets for military use and coordinaba all the jobs . 
the committee was monasteries in lituania , but after of two years of activity , the saw interrupt for the beginning of the war . 
other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics offenders in the press poland after of the war thank the work of the society poland of astronáutica ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) . 
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine problemy the ago reference for first once to the society with four articles timeframes very dedicated to the astronáutica . 
in one of them , the prof . m. subotowicze , the proposed the creation of a society that the devoted to the cosmonautics . 
in that time already the had since in direction projects of artificial satellites and was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with prospects of future . 
since principles of 1956 the society poland of astronáutica ( pta ) hoped to delusion part of the international federation of astronáutica ( defamation in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the pta the became in member plenary . 
the year next the first president of the pta , kazimierz zarankiewicz ( jurkovic - 1959 ) , happened to be the vice of the international federation of astronáutica . 
occupy this office until its death in 1959 . 
to onwards the 1956 , the pta spinelli of significant way in the development the rocket probe rm ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , that was a success and the became in the first rocket polish in the that the transaction to carried scientific research . 
the first type rm-1 was complete in 1957 and the launched for first once the 10 of october of 1958 . 
the rocket had a normalisation of 1.800 metres , few 80 cm of length and not victimised to the 5 kg of weight . 
more afternoon , the ended of build the version rm-1a and in summer of 1959 the 210 the evidence airlines of the rockets rm-2 of two stages in the desert of błędów . 
the rocket severs 1,4 metres and few pesaba 11,5 kg. 
another type of rocket in development thought to be subjected of study scientist real . the rocket rm-34 thought to have a normalisation of 14,5 km and its would mission control the wind of height . 
however , in 1962 the dissatisfied the jobs . 
the successor of the first rockets the type rm was the rocket meteor-1 , that the built during the years 1962 and 1965 . 
the diseñó as rocket of two stages , with a length total of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32,5 kg. 
the alamos three types ( called meteor-1a , -1b and -1c ) , that the differed between yes for the available space for the apparatus scientists . 
in the rocket meteor-1a the available space for the volume was of 0,4 litres , in the meteor-1b of 0,34 litres and in the meteor-1c of 0,62 litres . 
the normalisation maximum in the three types was of 37 km. 
between the years 1965 and 1968 the developed in the institute air the rocket meteor-2 , whose stages evidence airlines the 210 in october of 1970 . 
the rocket meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of wear a weight useful of 10 kg until 60 km of height . 
subsequently the built the meteor-2h version and meteor-3 . 
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the cospar ( openly speed space roslin ) in the year 1960 and the training the national committee of cospar two years after . 
in the framework the programme interkosmos , poland the joined to the research the space cósmico on artificial satellites soviets and , in the year 1978 , the pilot polish miroslaw hermaszewski the became in the second intercosmonauta after of vladimir remek . 
the suspension of the law on social jobs is not the solution . 
the week the constitutional trial suspended the law traabajos social . 
the resolution subtitled a heated discussion in the society . 
since then will interesting examining the reflection existing since a point of view more broader . 
the economic systems liberals in the eu , equals that in the world globalised , the based in the principle of a greater economic competition and least regulation . 
in consequence , this mean that the different economic forms and the economic systems national are in conflict permanent between yes . 
the cause the contempt in the principle the free trade and the free movement and unlimited of private capital , along with the financial speculation unbridled . 
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) produces economic tensions . 
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the imports of goods cheap , try distances shorten and for this &quot; arouses a bajadda &quot; the price the competitor with the objective of asking with the greater part the market and , of this way , increase its margin of profits . 
to great scale mean , for the majority of the employers , enterprises the production the abroad , buy there more cheaper or well disappear . the result is an unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work , in comparison with other economies , is more high . 
due to that the private capital has not social responsibility some and , with this , either is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon creates , grows necessarily the social expenditure the state . 
whole this situation evicted the total armenian of the employers for pay taxes and compensate the economic damage and social that have lie in its mercy of obtain profits . 
the situation is universally so familiar that is not necessary submit data statisticians specific . 
the practices escrupulosas little the private capital pointless situations , in certain economies , in the that the governments of these countries the affected forced to compete with the objective of reduce artificially the social level of the own population and , of this way , attract capital abroad the country . 
said of another way , the governments rose private capital to available of its own population however have in account the social decline . 
this the ago patent on everything in the changes of the laws valid . 
the objective is forcing to the population to that accepted the dictated the private capital , on everything in what that concerning to the wages . 
this has place , for a part , through the system of economic duty in the case of unemployment of long term ; for another , through the right restricted of the employees in concerned to rights labour . 
the result is a poverty growing along with the increase of the differences between poor and rich . 
since ago a series of years , there in germany points of delivery of food for poor people that not can prohibition with its own work . 
the number of people that receive this type of aid arrives already the million . 
in the framework the migratory of the competitiveness of the economy german , the produces a case quite prevalent : people blubber with a wage so under that the must state pay the rest for reach the minimum absolute for survive . 
the did public a scandal of this type connected with the situation of the employees revelations the federal parliament german . 
the measures of saving of virtually all the states the south of the eu gets , however place to doubts , to the same situation . the people , repeated for a decline abismal of its social level , the affected forced to migration as in the century 19th or to malvivir with a wage rotten in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day comes the country capital private investor . 
is necessary preguntrarse of where next ? 
in the case of that the conceal of other countries of the eu , then the poverty running of a country to another or arrives not never , since that chinese , indian , brazilian , turks , moroccan , egyptians or african still working for a tiny part of a wage european . 
this affects also to whole america latin . 
the theories liberals and the media of communication rooks until the nauseam that the state not should proof capital to the economy , that directing the economy despair to its failure . 
the private capital reasoning with tooth and tooth the theories of that the state not should intervene in the entrometiéndose economy in the control . 
to continuation , is necessary wonder if the private capital not stress with its egoism in the direction policy and , for precedent , in everything the state . 
in this case the answer is clearly definite . 
the test is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very powerful and curse , in all the states . 
the result is a situation desperately that the clings in the area of the corruption , in the mutual lobbies , in a legislation that is virtually reprehensible in all sides but is not offence . 
in germany the situation is the next : the ministries state , to lack of financial media , bureaux the wording of projects of law to legal companies private , the subjects are to often linked with the industry . 
this type of projects of law are democratically after in the bundestag , the parliament german . 
of this way , everything the power not perceive the people , perhaps and as the announces in the constitutions of the democracies western , but of the strong financial groups that represent their own interests . 
is obvious that the democracies with an urging liberal the cork quickly in a situation how the that describes appiános in its masterpiece the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesar and pompeya : &quot; the state wearing desintegrándose time and the administrations the voluntarily to the strength &quot; . 
to change of bribery , lobbies ilegítimamente results and aid for finance stones or functionaries . 
the admissions and the corruption the nets however unhindered hinted and the people xuar to the ballot with the vote apalabrado of advance &quot; ... &quot; not had people with character that aspirara to a since in the administration , so that an once , to cause of this disorganisation , the state rugova eight months consuls however &quot; ... &quot; started to hears in seriously of that the single remedy for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary picking a man forceful &quot; ... although appiános truly in pompeya , caesar promising the power and transformed the democracy for always in autocracy . 
the conclusion , the same way that in the antiquity , is that the current society the based in insensitive preferences the individual benefit however have in account the common interests . 
the private capital is not capable , in its essence , of understand and extinction the profits of whole the society . 
the result is the same that the of then , a decay of the elite however unprecedented , however that the investigated an effort for rapist in depth . 
the causes the booming of the regimes fascist and must communist sought , for what therefore , in the liberalisation unbridled of the economic systems in the century 19th and 20th . 
with respect to the current situation , is possible considered the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of type liberal , as a break defined , to the expected the next coup . 
the done really demoledor is that the current elite ignores for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , social disasters and catastrophes of the that we been witnessing , so as the crimes against the humanity , perhaps and as the know in the history former and the more recent . 
the suspension of the law on public tenders is not the solution ; the least not to long term . 
under pressure of the economic competition , therefore to level international as within of the eu , the government of the republic czech the deliveries forced to continue other search ways for reduce the social level of the population . 
this trend is , for what therefore , systemic . 
the solution running for reforms sociopolíticas specific , that targeted therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the private capital in the society in benefit the state . 
israel : the laboratory the chaos . 
&quot; that nothing comes degradation violence bamst nothing ever could &quot; ( arises not nothing of the violence and could nothing do ) , sting in its song fragile and whose estribillo finish &quot; cleanup &apos; lloyd do not forget princeton fragile we canaries &quot; ( not us forget of what fragile that are ) . 
&quot; if my children not regrettable wars , not would no &quot; gutele schnaper , wife of mayer amschel rothschild , in its bed of death in the year 1849 . 
after of the latter waves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza , have misunderstandings , as always , several reactions . 
a , the side of israel , jørgensen to favour the right of self and encasilla to the palestinians in the pioneering of terrorists . the another supports to the palestinians and alleges racism for part the state of israel , genocide yermolin against arab palestinians and unscathed to israel of state terrorist . 
not want focus in who is guilty of the massacres that the repeat updated and who is the victim . the end and the carried , the citizens of today in day of israel , including the territories employed , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the biotechnological of the violence . 
my intention is offer to the readers a scrutinise behind the curtain , a scrutinise for compromising who advantage of the tensions that the dramatically since ago 95 years ( calculated to onwards of the declaration balfour in november of 1917 ) in a small surface of land the middle half . 
some of my considerations the based in historical facts , other in conclusions to the that i come on the basis of my own way of understand the subject , on who or what group of people is the ecall main of the events of the history modern . 
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in first liikanen . 
in each time we find an alexander or a napoleon . 
but what that already is not so obvious is if always were these believing the that commensurate their steps of martial way or if behind of its ukip had someone that orientaba their actions towards a salmon objective . 
we accept that live in a time that policing the wealth the world in the hands of few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means , not has able reach in a voice generation . 
of between these astronómicamente families richest stresses a that could regarded the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what know , but not what honourable ) : the rothschild . 
not the writes much to closely of them . 
course . 
in the years 90 the century 19th bought the first agency of news ( reuter ) for that imagine of subcontracting its name with criminal acts of very severity . the power and the wealth , or both , them portions the outbursts , thing that for them always grunge a penal . 
have shareholding important in almost all the central banks the world and in those countries in the that not are coordinating , has declared or the is preparations a war : before the attack to afghanistan were 7 countries , after the attack of iraq were 5 , after of regime to gaddafi only midday four , but meantime russia has counts the central bank the government russian . 
everything time that has tried anyone to this family has died . 
abraham plaque the refused to renew the state the central bank deutsche of cds of the rothschild , started during the war of secession to reprinted money and was assassinated in plaque in the theatre . 
arrar started to reprinted money and wanted suspend the system of federal reserve ( fed ) and was assassinated in 1963 ; the congressman louis mc fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after of prefers exceeding to the fed for have outrage the great economic crisis the year 1929 . 
its mercy for the power world them transaction during the years 1859 - 1871 to hürriyet a plan with three wars , designed for the masón reginald pike , vichy with the degree 33 . 
the first war the espoused as objective eliminate the large states monárquicos in whole europe ; the second wanted eliminate the aryan colonial , particularly of great britain , and the third the proposed reduce the population of the land between half million and billion million of people ( arrogance amount of slave for its welfare and luxury voiced and not consumirían archaeological resources ) , addition of the creation of a religion universal ( the ecumenismo is not nothing more that a ral for arrogance solution ) and the final adoption of the powers resounding . 
the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest , along with the rothschild , remains the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the manhunt send of a solution ( order ab cao - order to onwards the chaos ) . 
these solutions are , however , flawed , and unfavourable always a worsening of the situation . if not , enough remember that the fed was created for that not the bailed a crisis as the year 1907 . 
so that , after the success the murder the abdullah the ukip austro-húngaro , francisco ferdinand , in sarajevo and after of that , to root of this , the erupted the first war world , tore the russia tsarist with the beginning of the revolution flank . 
the first war world darina of way sudden and unjustified since the point of military view and economic , the capitulation of germany ( the wars for crack with the russia tsarist were already unnecessary ) and the manhunt armenia of the great power of central europe , the empire austro-húngaro . 
for prepare the ground of the second war world , allowed that the bankers and political palette , of way untouchables , a situation escalating to root of the enormous extracted of war unworthy on germany , with what that the explorers the conditions privileged for the radicalisation of the inevitability impoverished . subsequently , them rescue with serve to the germans the solution the führer , that was what enough strong and simple and respectable to culprits , and build after a czechoslovakia consisting for several ifremer with a strong minority german that publishes represent and 82 so well the function of the fifth spine , that prendió the habeas and provoked the outbreak of the war . 
the end the century 19th , the rothschild impulsaron the foundation the movement sionista , an offshoot that hoped to the training of a state jewish , preferably in the region of the former judea with jerusalem as capital ( return the sión ) . 
the declaration balfour linkage previously beside the foundations for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and detected the first conflicts with the population arab the place . 
the um attacks terrorists in sides . 
bubble the second war world : is difficult know if hitler promptly too of the merry to the that what unequally control the international bankers in a principle or if everything what that did statute part of a plan . however , the suffering of the jews europeans in the camps of concentration ecall the conditions privileged for the acceptance the state jewish in the society world . 
israel was monasteries officially in 1948 and , of similar way the way in that the extracted of war unworthy to germany paved the road towards the second war world , with the proclamation the state of israel the ecall the spotlight for a third war . 
if the international bankers succeed iniciarla , the nation jewish , the equals that in the second war world , the battlefield in victim in first line of combat , now along with the population arab or , generally , muslim the middle half . 
israel is a laboratory relapse , a machine of solder and chaos , not only in the framework of its country , but also to scale international . take as example how the split of way targeted the abolish and opponents of israel . 
who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict palestino-israelí ? where the injustice marginalization injustice in a spiral of violence chestnut , if the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and its mercy for the power world ? 
in this point is necessary distinguish between the inhabitants of israel and their responsibly , because , the equals that happening in our country , the international bankers only inherently to their candidates in the elections . 
the current president of israel b. netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , premise to the international bankers , that ago everything what possible for undemocratic the war to iran and , recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai ( china , india , russia , pakistan ... ) , threaten in norm in a global conflict and , if we in account that iran controls the contact of ormuz , for where running the 20 % of everything the oil world ( the broker of navigation has only two miles of millimetres ) , peer to the destruction of the economy world . 
under what light the show now the words that uttered david rockefeller in 1994 : &quot; what single that need is a crisis general and the people hebé of agreement with a new order world . &quot; 
the new order world in its imagination is a world of karadžić and slave . 
a world in the that the rest of the population serves to a handful of people that form part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated . 
a world in the that to each new individual the him brands a chip the conceived that controls everything its be . 
&quot; and obliges to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a brand in the hand right or in the front , to not power buy nor sell , to not be that squares the name of this monster or the figures of its name . 
is necessary understand : who successful two fingers of front , that grand the numbers of this monster . 
the number brand to the person and this number is payback sixty and six &quot; . 
film odysseus : if the puts crude , elsewhere to hollywood 
in november of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students islamists gudermes the embassy american in tehran and took 52 diplomados as hostage . 
its decommissioning in freedom thought to be to change the destronado shah mohamed réza páhlevi , the which after of the revolution fled to ee.uu , country that had patrocinado its regime during decades . 
for the administration american the situation not infringement no positive perspective : throwing the shah for the overboard not the what could allow , since that , if what anachronistic , adduced in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries . 
but the decommissioning in freedom of the hostage in iran , where the revolution had interrogation in the constitution the theocratic regime , not was to its extent . 
was a coup the prestige of the united states , that subsequently the intensified still more with the attempt mountainous of freeing to the hostage for the strength . 
the diplomats imprisoned were recaptured 444 days after of the intervention chapters the government of algeria . 
in ee.uu. , its destination inconveniences a wave of solidarity and ill against iran . 
the failure in iran winnipeg of decisive way to the defeat of carter front ronald reagan in the presidential elections of 1980s . 
the film &quot; odysseus &quot; the director and actor ben affleck tematiza an episode of this history , that cosechó a small success for america . 
little before of occupy the embassy , the escaped six employees the building . 
after of a complicated periplo , ended in the residence of the embassy canadian . 
cia , in collaboration with the authorities canadians , managed extract of iran , for this pulling a history backdoor a point prose : managed with passports canadians , as member the team film that represented the spotting in the country for the imagine of a producing of science fiction . 
combination of mixing 
the plan that bourlanges the expert in &quot; exfiltración &quot; toni mendez coordinated the collaboration of hollywood . 
for that the lie prompt divulged , the wrote on the project film in magazines rme , the organised conferences of press , the society of virtual production had even a clearance real . 
the details on the operation the temperament in secret during much time , the film has done to onwards of the memories of tony mendez . 
the film of affleck is a combination odd of several mixing . 
for a side , a political thriller realistic ; for another , a called &quot; caper movie &quot; , the history of an episode that went well , a deception ( a can example be the series ocean &apos; lloyd push ) . 
in the film the combined the states of frame . encounter for a side rundown well documented of tehran . in the sequence of appropriations the show photographs flagship of the time of the events , that were plasmados the same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard . 
for the another , authoritarian scenes of hollywood a therefore more lighter , marked for the irony and a corner grossly . 
and addition , scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions : men trajeados that analyse the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , for telephone ... 
ben affleck has managed restart its career of a way excellent . 
the actor , that had been subjected of mocked , has become in a respectable director and its way of act has left of be the white of ironic comments . 
odysseus is its third largometraje , after of &quot; small goodbye , goodbye &quot; ( 2007 ) and the thriller &quot; the town . city of amputated &quot; ( 2010 ) . 
the same time , is the first film of affleck in the that the action has not place in the city of boston , where the fattened . 
also , the sensitivity of perspectives the atmosphere the place was a feature that footing to the managers of films wholeheartedly for above of standards of hollywood . 
and affleck what shows in odysseus , where tehran the &quot; wheel &quot; in canada . 
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events entirely . the sequence introductory of the decision of the embassy is impressive for its capacity sinóptica that , the same time , trasmite the maiden the confusion and of the lack of foresight that arises when , in some place , the history da a step forward . 
affleck and their collaborators obtaining a similar effect in the scenes imaginative ( the team impostor in the bazaar of tehran ) . 
too action in places too 
the director had that accept the done of that a history explained offers not much in the sense film of the scenes more schemers . 
and the complicated quite well . to sometimes him adds something to the reality : here not collserola everything of way so lobster ( the scene in that threatens the crisis in the airport of tehran , the deviation of a called to america and the search unbridled after its watergate the demonising in a madness ) . 
the flaqueza of odysseus is the lampedusa that arises of the need of show too action in places too . 
alan arkin and john goodman have a role very funny as collaborators of hollywood , although their believing the deserved more space and not are , nor much least , the ones in this filme . 
for these reasons , the film of affleck loses a little of dramatic sketch , but is a film that the can continue with an interest moderate , pander its realisation and the style retro of a thriller that appealing the years 70 . 
but that the electrician , that will difficult . 
as umpteenth of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the notions of omnipresencia and omnisciencia of the services secret , is enough .

what destabilise with the done of that in our country the overturned much grain and , as consequence of the calls shopping of intervention , the state had the stores lax and the had that export . 
according palas , given that the republic czech is far of the ports seaports , the should eu pagarnos hundreds of million of eur . 
the final , the commission european the showed willing to help to the republic czech and organised a contest public for the buying the grain of the countries that not have access the sea . 
the subsidy for receiving a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the ministry for the local development booklet for the minister pavel němec ( us-deu ) . specifically , is exclusively to the wording of applications of subsidies of brussels . 
eu : the hearted rare are an exception 
the guidelines of the states member are to often white of criticisms , the efforts of the eu in bioethanol of regulations and , also , a functioning and development more effective in whole the union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition . 
according the experts , the problem more serious is , for example , the collection of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration european , but that the states member have managed in the negotiations on budgets . 
to the czechs also them dime the sensitive flax , the same way that to other countries of the union , the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products , although our country not always hague won putin of these pugnas . 
the czechs , after six years of disputes with germans and austrian , flank with success the designation of origin the requesón of specialties , but had that christening the name the national rum , whose tradition in our country the back the century 19th , and happened to sir &quot; tuzemák &quot; . 
only the products processing to onwards the distilled of cane of can sugar be integrated rum , but not those facts to onwards of beet of sugar . 
in the textile official of designations of origin protected of the eu , along with the cutter brined and bergamo known in everything the world , the mazapán of the city german lübeck or the ham of ham , already the find for example the shortbread of karlovy , the carpa of pohořelice and of třeboň and , even , the variety of hop of žatec . 
as maras protected of the eu , able be proud the bread of jengibre of pardubice and the karlovy of hořice v podkrkonoší . 
the people wants that barnabei the republic , but am an amateur , says okamura 
mr senator , how the him happened stand to the elections for president ? 
not the is of be senator or president . 
if in our country outside everything well , then not introduce my candidacy . 
but already not can arrogance see how the monies in the years twenty years in our country , how the amputated remain unpunished , the increases the taxes and the age of retirement . 
not had ambitions of be political . 
when see something that i don &apos;t like , attempt give with a solution for amended . 
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent , the single possibility that i of change the things is imagine as senator or president . 
the senate has already come , but little after has since in road towards the presidency . 
is not giving the backs to objectively people that what have voted ? 
always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended of the results in the elections the senate . 
more afternoon precisé that if lidón elected senator , introduce my candidacy to the presidency . 
but my objective is not the function ; the function is the tool with the that can do reality my own ideas . 
for that need the greater possible influence and the mandate more strong possible . 
the problem is not only that let a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television , but that pisoteamos to anyone that wants initiate a change . 
to this the him cancel the media of communication , that you discredit and bargain the freedom of expression with the freedom of lying . 
of me the says that i sobornado to journalists or that i been adviser of jiří . 
going to speak of their ideas . 
the external to the presidential fight with financial theories and criminal responsibilities of political and the declaration of the property for above of twenty million . 
for this must change the law . 
as president has not this competition and only the senate in its whole can propose laws . 
how wants tackle ? 
as citizen , i earthquakes part of a group of pressure for that the profession of guide the libyan as work decentralised , and what succeeded . 
the problem is in the policy : if someone arrives with a good proposal , already be of wing or of left , the rejects to purpose and this affects to the citizens . 
as candidate independent , correspondence of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups . 
encasillamientos however nor dogmas of party , i the capacity of power picking something of each party that be better for our country and apply . 
the viewed more well a man of wing or of left ? 
since the point of view czech , i the impression that the people i viewed more of left . 
for me has not importance , already be a little of left or a little of wing . 
what that i care is that greed forward . 
i don &apos;t care if someone is of wing or of left , want abreast to the people . 
always support openly any solution good , regardless of if the proposal next the ksčm or of the ods and , the same way , shall in against of the bad ideas . 
ago joke when the says of ud. that is populist . 
but not what is demonstrating with what that says ? 
when the creates a plan entrepreneurship for the company , you conceals also objectives and ideals . 
and intentas couldn to them . 
will those what called populism , but all the proposals of the that speaking already work in the world or known experts speak of them . 
but however the support the parliament only him remain slogans . 
and with this not can survive in the policy to long term . 
or believes you that if the foremost to the people and speaks with them , sacking , for example , a responsibility criminal and financial ? 
i don &apos;t another option . 
persuade to political , to journalists and to the society civil and try stained of my part for lot . 
if outside elected president , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct for television in the which tabling to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that legitimaran the responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and prosecutors the state . 
and , eventually , them sooner that communicate basques not what want . 
if there a strong character that it the disputes , the can do pressure in the scene policy . 
take for case the choice direct the president , that has been an achievement of the pressure public . 
the same time tell that only am an amateur , not am nor a genie nor an intellectual . 
for my opinions and ideals attempt seek allies . 
just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater possible support for my programme . 
attempt demean the things forward i same , but in case of that doubts not well , within of six years what contribution and back the private sector . 
sounds a little as if okamura outside to save the republic czech . 
not am no salvador . 
know that with a person repairs not nothing , for that i visited to a series of personalities trend , for if to what better the animaran to submit its candidacy the senate . 
went to see to radim jančura , but the refused because had much work . 
for my part , for what least i supported to the journalist of research jana lorencová , that hunts to the light the frauds with meats lightweights of heating . 
i invade caricature of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied , now am in the renewables . 
the sixty for percent of the population droves not to the ballot and , those that what made , voted to the representatives the yobs . 
in the senate are two the sector independent . 
the people jade the senate , of perhaps way that will complicated achieve changes . 
however , i banal my own ideas , as for example the choice direct of mayors or of governors . 
is recital delusion its own party ? 
still not what i considered because i don &apos;t time for this , for check the past unblemished of each one of the potential member the party , nor either i money . 
i don &apos;t money nor for the campaign to the presidency , in my account transparent only there 20.000 nok . 
has not money ? 
speaks of statements of the property , how is the yours ? 
clarification my private property in few 60 million . 
in prague i a ground valuated in 25 million , a floor valuated ten million , another floor tasado in eight million , an embracing of works of art with a value of ten million , an aston martin of few 3,5 million and a škoda superb valuated in a million , and in the account i a couple of million . 
for true , i an aston martin because was my dream of youth . always i pleased james rantings , that berg this car , was galante with the women and , the same time , struggled against the maldades and injustices . 
despair an aston martin , its property is valued in 60 million and has not money for the campaign ? 
ud. says that wants change the republic but wants not put too money of its part . 
is not very convincing . 
i don &apos;t 15 million for the campaign . 
i that endeudarme ? 
in the campaign already i since 2,5 million . 
the done of that not successful no inc shows that not there too interest in my programme . 
and i don &apos;t the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket . 
the expenditure of the campaign shipowners in essence what that detailed in concept of salary of senator . 
but not could live of this . for example , not could robbing to my son the school english , that costs 30.000 nok dm . 
if like only win money , then i don &apos;t introduce as candidate . 
so that continue with its activity entrepreneurship for power live ? 
has not said before that thought to stop this activity ? 
this has not nothing that see with a salary greater . 
as i promised , in part i left my activities . 
for example , the representative of my agency of travels happens to be my substitute in spring . 
the people tastes that outside the samaritano that salvase the republic . 
but i also need live of something . 
how purse to win monthly as entrepreneur ? 
between 200.000 and 400.000 , that scepticism won . 
if outside president , then recompensed the business .

the study of architecture mvrdv shows that the revelations adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of spijkenisse and the baby mission &quot; mountain of books &quot; - 2 photos 
&quot; believe that the building is fun , has an aspect futurista , and for end there something interesting that see &quot; , says lisette verhaig , a passer that running for the street . 
and stefan spermon , technician of warmest in a great company antwerp closely of the library , finger : &quot; addition , the building is nice &quot; . 
but i wonder for what need a library today in day . 
all we internet , medication and electronic books . 
nobody enters for taste in these libraries agitation of fashion , not ? 
spijkenisse , a city bedroom antwerp to the doors of rotterdam that deserves hardly a fugaz visit , holds the questionable honour of avoided levies with a record for forget . 
the population of 80.000 external inhabitants the rate of literacy more low of the countries netherlands . 
for counter this situation so disgraceful , ago some years the decided contribution of some way to the culture general and caricature the seven bridges bosses that appear coordinating in the notes of euro in way of miniaturas of concrete friedenau decoradas . 
the success of the offensive amusing was limited . 
and so was as the responsible political keeper that only existed a possibility for improve the statistics : had that build a library ! 
winy maas , the study of architecture dutch mvrdv , everything a proxy in the art of the organizer of bars and responsible of funny buildings to the couple that quai , the took the subject with its customary prudently and dalmau to the presentation the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face . 
and while the jury telescope oswiecim to its around and the encogía of shoulders , maas romanians to blown the books for size forming a pyramid and m3 its brief speech with the follows words : &quot; dear fellow : 
here the have , my proposal for the mountain of books of spijkenisse , the called `boekenberg &apos; &quot; . 
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of eur the worsens in the place resolve . 
is way part the project of managed , that the full with a parking underground , a supermarket , an office of mails and a couple of buildings of residential and adosados . 
to principles of november the mountain of books was sakharov with the second prize &quot; review library of nl 2012 &quot; . 
addition , the project is also nominado the &quot; dutch cardiff bretton award 2012 &quot; . 
of this way , the small city protested of history , that until the date not had nothing more that offer that an area smartest posmoderna and a mega ridiculously dreadfully after whose frontage white one intuiría more well a central farm , account now with a masterpiece of contemporary architecture . 
but on everything , spijkenisse disposal now the first cultural building public of its history . 
the long road until the book 
the first impression is that the is of a paradise of books under a quesera . 
is well true that there a lift that us stored fair the centre of this hallandsåsen montañoso , but the culprits dracula the space and the reading not what guns , but that prefer fundirse with its topografía to each step of its escalation to the top . 
the internal completely acristalado is indoctrinated and easy of seasonal with the view , the soil of mortar recocido and the elegant farolas support of unequivocal way the condition public of the library . 
the environment urban is perfect . 
the raise the view the can reach to visualizar the banks the park , the dogs and the children and girls playing the football . 
and for all books everywhere , books and more books . 
&quot; normally the shelves of books are conversely to what long of the frontage and in the centre the opens an enormous room dark that , for what general , shade be something bitter and impersonal &quot; , says winy maas . 
what that we done us is put turvy the classic configuration esa and demean the area of reading the internal the foreign . 
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the half the find the offices , the library of internet , the club of chess , the centre of environmental education and the room of maintenance . 
special finger deserve the shelves pages that tries the functions of mural diamond , parapeto and barandilla the same time . 
the view , the coins and the olfato are strangers . 
even the architects and the engineers civilians more the day shake the head when shrieked speak of this material unknown . 
&quot; wanted work with materials recycled &quot; , us explains joop trouborst , head the project in the city of spijkenisse . 
and is so as a day , in an agricultural exploitation frisian , us scrum with the feed adequate orthopaedic of the agriculture . 
since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands the used a fabric plastic of scarce millimetres of thickness as basis for sujetar the roots of the crops . 
the is of a material cheaper and efficient . 
this fabric dust profile two stations and after the battled . 
for the library this fabric the prensó , for first once in such quantities , until achieving illustrations of four centimetres of thickness . 
with the heat and the pressure , the called plastic agricultural ( klp ) flux of colour and the becomes in a material dark , transcending and durable that smacks to a mix of new car and zapatilla of sport . 
after 105 frontage the arrives to the top of the mountain . 
the final of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain us facing the rewarded : since the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city , but that in she also the can enjoy of to tasty croquetas budgeting and their ficus acres in enormous pots . 
these pointless an environment atmosphere to the couple that hushed the moisture pollution appropriate for this mountain of literature . 
donations for a new soul 
&quot; although russians believe brief their large installing glass , this building is a project exemplary in what that concerning to the ecology &quot; , it trouborst . 
the heating and the necessary cooling the fairly to onwards of geothermal energy . 
to despite of that the mountain of books is antwerp under an enormous pyramid of glass , even in the days more soleados the sun only glitters during few hours in its internal . 
the enormous cerchas of wood enacted in sense 109 to the frontage of glass serve for give shadow and sucked the majority of the infrared the sun . 
this creates an internal climate confortable . 
the rest is thing of the late shutters . 
stefan spermon , the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information , already has dared to put the foot in the new library . 
and lisette verhaig has also state there . 
equally , the teacher of traditional medicine china munashe bogarde has visited the library . she afghan the &quot; boekenberg &quot; as the &quot; soul belatedly &quot; of spijkenisse . 
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , the invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of its private embracing . 
of this way the intend fill , of moment , the subban ópticos of a library that still not account with its inquiries completely ; in has currently 70.000 copies . 
the concept has assertions burrowed . 
the shelves are teem . 
&quot; not there nothing worst that a library half empty &quot; , says the architect winy maas . 
&quot; believe that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building . 
all know that its book way part of the library . 
although reins only it for embellish . 
of this way , the study mvrdv has managed everything a success in that discipline queen that in the argot specialises the knows as &quot; creation of an identity &quot; . 
the city of spijkenisse has writing a thunder of the history of the literature . 
regardless of what young and inculta that can be . 
for end a point of starting for shaping its identity . 
szabo : &quot; the must germans play a role more role &quot; 
germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine . 
according stephen szabo , expert in the relations usa . uu.-europa , this bordering to berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky . 
deutsche welle : to principles of week , germany took to understand that vote in against of the proposal of assume to the territories palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un . 
however , finally berlin the abstained . 
for what ? 
stephen szabo : germany supports not what that the israelis have done in gaza . 
now well , due to the special relationship that unconventional the country with israel , must germany have careful . 
but the same time believe that either supports the position fragmented . 
germany wanted demonstrate its independence however be too criticism with israel . 
during the upheaval that had place in libya in march of 2011 , germany also the abstained when of what that the upwards was of establish an area of ban of flight . 
is has been malpractice finally for the nato . 
him is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in game international subjects important ? 
yes , is so . 
this the must to that in these moments is erbakan its foreign policy , fulfil of a policy demagogue , for so say , for the united states and centering in a foreign policy german . 
and what that makes still more the things is that the europeans not have a policy coherent and uniform . 
for what therefore , the germans the find in a crossroads . 
of them the expected that mediating a pioneering more independent , but not are utilising to do . 
believe that still are operating what will its role , but already have initiated the road towards a foreign policy normal &quot; . 
a foreign policy similar to the countries as france or great britain . 
what mean specifically a foreign policy normal &quot; since the point of view german ? 
is a policy that , when the is of national interests , the is willing to defend different clash to the of united states or their partners europeans . 
believe that the foreign policy german crossroads a strong motivation in the economic policy , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be russia , china or middle next . 
the economic interests germans are until true different point to the of other large powers and for that reason must germany protect their interests . 
these economic interests have unforeseen in the position adopted with regard the conflict in middle next and in the vote of the un ? 
for a side , germany account with large markets in middle next , particularly in the gulf . 
for this must reason be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public arab nor either of the élite arab . 
this is important , for course . 
but i not him virtual haste importance since that not the is of a relationship completely unilateral . 
however , yes play a role fundamental in the considerations german . 
has posted germany its relationship with usa . uu. the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine ? 
believe that in europe , and even in united states , the position german immense of an enormous degree of understanding . 
for this reason , not believe that the hague forthcoming a break so drastic as in the case of libya . 
perhaps with this germany hague achieved inquisitor a true respect . 
the end and the carried , everything this has not done but demonstrate that is a country the that forging in seriously as international actor and whose interests there that have in account . 
in europe there different opinions about of the initiative palestine . 
in change , usa . uu. has shown clearly to favour of a veto . 
there amendable of opinions between usa . uu. and many european nations ? 
always have round these due disparities to the internal policy american . 
believe that the government of obama is in secret a great understanding towards the position european . 
but , to cause of the situation policy that the venus here , is obvious that the government not can defend in public that position . 
believe that the real amendable of opinions has not in reality the perceive that the him attaches . 
if looked the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu , see that obama is not for enthusiastic nothing with the policy that develops . 
him is difficult to germany reconcile the disagreements relations that keeps with israel and united states , for a side , with the position of their main partners in the eu , for another ? 
believe that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans . 
for course that would a little more easy for the germans if existent a policy european coherent and homogenous , but is not the case . 
for what therefore , not have the possibility of delusion part of a broadcasting higher , but that must spur the things since its own position . 
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro . 
believe that in the future germany financed a role of leadership to the hour of forcing to europe to adopt a position european . 
for course that this is not easy nothing for germany , already be simply for the relationship that keeps with israel . 
this has been always a subject handles . 
but believe that the germans have clear that must play the role of icing independent . 
the sees germany to same yes in the role of international actor important ? anyone in reality germany assume a role ? 
or perhaps him remains underdeveloped difficult accept that leadership ? 
germany still not has saxons , is always uncomfortable something and , for obvious reasons , the country him remains costing play a role more important . 
if irregularities the crisis the euro , for example , see that each once that germany the osce as actor main , the yielding conceals feelings antialemanes . 
this is not easy for the germans . 
the is of an old problem and is that nobody wants be surrounds of the countries enemies . 
seen of this way , germany the crossroads in a position much more difficult that united states . 
must show an attitude inclusive front to the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy . 
the influence of usa . uu. in the policy european sandstorm each once more , but the eu not cover of moment that vacuum , who remains then ? 
to the germans not them tendering more remedy that assume a role more role . 
even if not them like , if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular , c &apos; est the vie !

&quot; protection of trademark &quot; in china : when puma and rolex the demonising of suddenly in trademark chinese 
rolex is a brand familiar to level world and pole ralph lauren also . 
but , what is rolex pole ? 
after this name the lurks a designation uk officially in china but that has not nothing that see with the original companies . 
not however , is immense of protection while the culprits epónimos not organigramme a demand . 
and even then is not clear that the them what to give the reason . 
&quot; to the foreign them is each once more difficult protect their trademark in china &quot; , it thomas pattloch , lawyer the bufete taylor wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme middle . 
each week arrives to my table a new case . 
the innovators simply add a couple of layperson for power nationality their trademark . 
of this way , gucci the becomes in lu-gucci and in place of prada the prada-kny countrywide . 
the companies german also the steal legally of the same way , perhaps and as him has happened the manufacturer of articles sporting puma . 
pattloch opens a filing in the that sleeve seats of the office of trademark of beijing . 
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china requested nationality the brand zegna aicm puma , a name artificial that also the useless of the home of fashion ermenegildo zegna . 
that the chinese are champions wars in that of caricature and of flout the rights of intellectual property is of rocard known . 
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting . 
however , the cases of pattloch are of another kettle . for dro of their customers , him fight against the done of that the office of trademark kreissl of way official to the companies chinese the right to demean advantage of a designation that is already uk in another place . 
the chinese what burdens &quot; bang ming pai &quot; or brand companion . 
the word has its origin in the term chinese &quot; bang dakuan &quot; , 
that ago reference to women that have &quot; fish &quot; to a man wealthy . 
the authorities chinese not the feel culprits 
&quot; is harmful for the business , there that fight against this &quot; , requires pattloch . 
&quot; the brand ago waters , the position monopolist disappears and the harm that suffers the image is enormous . &quot; 
the financial losses and the procedural shores of the sectors affected are pound , on everything in the case of products flagship of luxury . 
according data of the company of analysis of market clsa , with a volume of 15.000 million of eur the year china is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the that grows to greater pace . 
however , achieve the annulment of enrolment of legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and addition supposed much money . 
the processes the can brandy until nine years and the result is uncertain . 
pattloch speaks of cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had slow therefore time that the name subjected of the demand already the had become in a &quot; reality of market &quot; . 
&quot; if the 180 has bad fortunately , perhaps even successful that pay money the plagiador because the process has damage to the brand of reasoning in china &quot; , it pattloch . 
in occasions this is the law of the jungle . 
some of the cases more known have that see with graphic elements . 
in 2009 daimler-benz lost an owed against the manufacturer of machinery of construction sany , the company that has been bridgwater ago little for the manufacturer german of bombs of concrete putzmeister . 
for that to day of today the can chinese continue passport an emblem very similar to the star of mercedes . 
the buyer of volvo , geely , benches the principle a logo in white and blue that cocteau in great measure to gbp ; the subject the dirimió in the courts and geely had that amend . 
the manufacturer of clothes lacoste lost in china against innovators arriving of hong and singapore whose logo ronald a crocodile ahead in the direction opposite the original . 
the authorities chinese not the feel culprits . 
the office of trademark ctmo in beijing recognises that in 2010 have had due difficulties to the shortage of equipment and staffing of personal . 
the year past , however , &quot; the situation of emergency labour eta to the usual &quot; . 
of this way , the amount of processes of complaint however tramitar has reduced in 22 % . 
almost 57.000 of these cases the properly resolved , 75 % more that the previous year . 
however , 81.500 complaints still pending of resolution . 
fight against this costs much money 
as shade be customary in china , the figures are surprising . 
the year past the ctmo droves more of 1,4 million of applications of protection of trademark , almost a third more that in 2010 . 
the incredibly of a new record and mean that china lidera for tenth year running the list of new enrolment in everything the world , according it the office of trademark . 
seems that this happens also with the number of footballs gestures , figure that repayments to 5,5 million in total . 
in 2011 the presumed embolsado 1.800 million of typhoon in concept of rights . 
said of another way , this mean that of average each register costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 eur . 
fight against this costs much money , perhaps and as shows the case of the company family german freudenberg . 
since ago more of seven years the group punch in the courts against an imitador chinese . 
if well the germans have managed stopping the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation , 
the imitador has achieved assured the rights chinese on the brand freudenberg . 
&quot; us ourselves we lie this situation because in germany the surnames not are protected &quot; , it hanno wentzler , president and adjust delegado of freudenberg chemical specialities in munich . 
the office of trademark ctmo also rejected the resource of the muniqueses . 
in the two follows delegate him have given the reason to freudenberg , but the part opposite remains fronts in the currently . 
there that have careful deal 
now the case has come to the doors the court higher of justice , where remains slope of resolution . 
wentzler confident in power resolve welcome the issue and extolls the professionalism of the courts . 
however , says also that &quot; the procedure is extremely expensive , therefore in terms of money as of time &quot; . 
is difficult estimate the internal costs ; the inquiries entrepreneurship has had that revise backlog of until hundred years of antiquity for power proof evidence . 
ago five years freudenberg promised to the part opposite a &quot; sum of six figures in eur &quot; with the objective of reach to an agreement friendly , but not had success . 
&quot; this shows what much that us care &quot; , it wentzler . 
the dangers that identifies in extreme middle caps even with affect to europe , 
specifically if the innovators the assure there the rights on trademark not protected . 
so , a manufacturer chinese tried nationality in germany the name freudenberg for shoes and products of skin . 
ago time that the group subsequently this area trade , not however galerie prevent the register . 
&quot; there that have careful deal &quot; , says wentzler . 
therefore him as the lawyer pattloch estimated to the companies german that underestimate extremely prudent to the hour of do business with china . 
not enough with confidence in the international legislation on rights of brand , but that what that there that do is &quot; nationality also in china everything achieved that can be room of protection &quot; , perhaps and as finger wentzler . 
of what contrary , the can subject disillusioned much more expensive that a simple registration . 
of done , in case of that freudenberg varied the finally provoked of its particular battle , then confirmation that pay to the part opposite rights of licence for its own name , perhaps and as explains wentzler . 
that or in the segment in issue us expulsarían the market . 
day world of the fight against the aids : dance , announces , help 
in ag approach the chorus imbongi and in swaziland the delighted the orphans the aids 
the history of a capable link of that overcome much more of 8.733 kilometres of distance . 
first the starts for the salon : boots of cowboy , slippers of basketball , shoes of ins and mocasines looking the compass on the soil of parquet , and what find quickly .

is monday for the afternoon and in the room of music the institute of medical gotcha of ag the chorus imbongi approach a new song . 
also have come the fifty singers , of between 23 and 69 years , since the genetista human until the boys of home . 
&quot; om &apos; obani &quot; is not an easy mentalities , each voice the chorus has a text different and addition in a foreign language hardly familiar : the zulú , a language spoken for eleven million of people in africa , botswana , lesotho , malawi , mozambique and in some areas of swaziland . 
aid for the self 
according an estimate of unaids , the programme of the nations un for the fight against the aids , in everything the world there approximately 34 million of people infected for the virus the hiv . 
23,5 million of them live in the south of africa . 
in swaziland there 245.000 orphans the aids . 
more the 40 % of the population is already 360 . 
the partnership voices speed condom has found in germany peacemaker for the 180 orphans the aids the people of esitjeni . 
seventy of them attend to the school choirs . 
for 15 or 20 eur the month the can apadrinar to a child . 
this final plug the rachinel of the school , the uniform and him ensure a food hot the day in the gogo horror . 
imbongi mean in zulú &quot; narrador of stories &quot; or &quot; panegirista &quot; . 
in this room nobody knows speak with fluidity this language bantú , but announces yes know . 
since ago ten years this chorus approach songs in this softly foreign language that in occasions sack transportarles to its place of origin : the south of africa . 
to 8.733 kilometres of distance in line straight since ag , in the atlantic the uk of swaziland , there a people called esitjeni that depends of the voices of this chorus german . 
the forty for percent is epidemics 
approximately 2.000 live people there , some still in surgery shacks of clay and hay , a great part of them are children . 
more of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed the aids . 
esitjeni is a small example of what that affects to swaziland : the rate of infection of aids more high and the hopes of life more sick of everything the world , according unicef . 
the population sees not with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according has demonstrated reduces to the half the risk of infection . 
more the 40 % of the inhabitants of swaziland are eels the virus of the infected , and die with something more of thirty years has become in something customary . 
during a journey whole to africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus injected this recóndita population , but what that forced on everything were many children in the streets that shacks not only of the protection of their parents , but of what main : food , clothes and training . 
however title school , the possibilities in a country poor are more that bleak . 
in a principle was solely the particular compromise of few what that anachronistic possible that a child outside the school and disfrutara of a food hot the day . everything this for few eur . 
however , a year after the chorus founded the partnership &quot; voices speed condom &quot; that since then has occupied profesionalmente of the orphans the aids in esitjeni . 
facts on the infections of sexual transmission 
what are the main diseases of sexual transmission ? 
between the incidence of origin bacteriano are the syphilis , the chlamydia and the gonorrea . 
the incidence of origin vírico more arise are the aids , the virus the papilloma human , the herpes genital or the hepatitis . 
the ladillas and the sarna the find between the incidence airborne for parasite . 
what are the main groups of affected ? 
the syphilis and the gonorrea the give with more often in men that hushed sexual relations with other men . 
the institute robert koch part of the basis of that the least four of each five cases of syphilis 511 in germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men . 
in the case of the adults heterosexuales the diseases of sexual transmission more arise are the infections for chlamydia , tricomonas , the virus the papilloma human , the candidiasis ( hongo ) and the gonorrea . 
the infection the hiv between the adults heterosexuales the country is relatively comparatively ; not however , approximately the 20 % of the new infections for hiv the sinai in this group . 
between the young , the infections for chlamydia are much more arise that in other groups of population . 
according european polls , three quarters of all the infections affect to young of between 15 and 25 years . 
in our country , the virus the papilloma human also the adds to the diseases more arise between the youth . 
how has strides the number of infections ? 
not all the diseases of sexual transmission are subject to declaration compulsory . 
according the institute robert koch , the number of infections for syphilis has doubled its figure of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011 . 
the number of new infections for hiv keeps a trend downward since 2007 . 
in 2011 the 780 approximately 2.700 cases . 
the is of a tenth part least that in the previous year . 
what symptoms indicate that the is of a disease venereal ? 
the infectious diseases can sino úlceras in the area genital , bother the orinar , flow , abdominal pain , so as ampollas or verrugas . 
to often not neurotic pain nor conclusive other symptoms and for that not the stem . 
how the can one protect ? 
the can condoms reduce the risk of infection , but not offered protection the hundred for hundred . 
some officers salmonella of diseases of sexual transmission also can automatically to through of infections for suciedad and for physical contact . 
for this reason , the experts estimated overwritten regularly to tests doctors , on everything if the flux with often of sexual partner . 
if the diagnosed of way early , the majority of the can incidence cured and is possible avoid any consequence belatedly . 
to through of institutionalised , donations and , for finally but not for this least important , of the refunded that reputable the chorus for their actions in whole germany , arriving to custom quite money . 
&quot; in total we sent already few 200.000 eur to esitjeni &quot; , it proud annette lennartz , madam of the partnership . 
in the own people zodwa dlamini a woman safe of same yes and with rhetoric of leadership administers the money sent since germany . 
the ranks of that the orphans cork a good cholera , for example with an of the grandmothers . 
the &quot; gogos &quot; , as the shape to the women elderly in zulú , are the pillars the people . 
some of them have until 14 orphans to its office , them offered a ceiling where live and the departments of that the children kashmir to the school all the days punctually and dressed with their uniform . 
the that not have to nobody remain under the protection of khanyisile , a woman unmarried that , the equals that the two cocineras that the bureaux of cooking all the days for more of 200 hungry children , fatigue a wage of the partnership . 
addition , &quot; voices of condom &quot; has since in direction a school of remnant , has built two gallineros and , in collaboration with the organisation healthcare american psi , has achieved that many of the inhabitants the people the remarkably subjected to a test of hiv . 
this is not obvious something , since that , to despite of what patent that is this disease in everything the country , not the shade speak openly of she . 
a king with 14 wives 
&quot; the aids is a taboo absolute &quot; , says annette lennartz , &quot; because has that see with the inappropriate &quot; . 
something strange in a country in the that the king has officially 14 wives . 
the finally nationalist absolute the africa black , the king mswati iii , is known for its style of life opulento and eighth of tripping . 
poligamia in place of democracy . 
this way of life partnerships not is officially in great responsible part of the spreads so fast that has gone the virus the hiv in the latter decades . 
but also the must to the countless temporeros that distances the country of a side to another and that what waiting beyond where van . 
according annette lennartz , &quot; in any corner the can achieving free condoms , but these hardly the guns . 
is another culture , here only accepted the contact skin against skin &quot; . 
for promote the cultural exchange , the chorus imbongi travels each two or three years for the south of africa lauper songs that speak of gloom , spirit combativo , hope and confidence in the race black , songs that many in the extreme more southern the continent african still request of the time the apartheid . 
a full bus of white that volumes songs in a language of black ; therefore recognition not brings only brings an excellent environment and very joy , but that has also achieved arrancarle a couple of tears to some that another soldier crossing rabioso . 
the journey them where always to esitjeni , where the exotic singers to the children apadrinados . 
to despite of that this small population hardly appearing in the maps , in the valley the river ezulweni is very familiar . 
acércate &quot; to esitjeni , there glitters the light &quot; , says the people the place . 
and after go the 8.733 kilometres in line straight of motor to ag until the rooms of trial of the street bergheimer teem of singers pointing the step , one the da account of that is also possible see denis its light since there . 
messenger : the notable nasa ice in mercury 
the probe messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice in mercury . 
probably the skating of successful ice a thickness of until 20 metres . 
the nasa , the agency esa fragmented , has oostlander evidence of the existence of ice in mercury . 
to despite of dealt the planet more practicable the sun , there also there water helada , perhaps and as the glean of three studies published the thursday in the magazine specialised &quot; bamst &quot; . 
the probe would messenger found evidence of that in the area the planet that the crossroads verge to the shadow has earthquakes a skating of ice . 
seems that is has the least 30 centimetres and probably even until 20 metres of thickness . 
the water proceeding possesses of cometas or , with great avoided , of asteroides that in its day collisions against mercury . 
nobody linked the discovery of ice with the possibility of that complied life in the planet , says the researcher head of the probe messenger , underestimate solomon . 
the temperature in can mercury achieve until 426 degrees celsius . 
however , the could findings help to uttered how have come the water and other components of the life to other areas the system solar . 
of way completely inadvertida for the inhabitants the planet land , the probes , telescopios and small robots as the phoenix the invent to exploring the inaudible the universe . 
of once in when send images to the land : small windows to the reaches the space . 
the image proceeding of a house developed for researchers germans the institute charisma planck . 
the eight planets that foetuses our system solar , addition the planet enano ceres . 
the equals that plutón , that tour around the sun fair for behind of envious , according the new definition the term mit for the union international penetrate in 2006 ceres is not no &quot; planet &quot; . 
this section of an image of infrared blot for the telescope spitzer is a &quot; bemba of family &quot; in the that appear infinitas generations of stars : the stars more wholeheartedly the show as points blue , although what more difficult of recognise is the colour pink of the stars &quot; baby deliberate &quot; . 
this region of training of stars , called of way little romantic for the scientists w5 , was discovered for the telescope spitzer in the constellation of casiopea , to a distance of 6.500 light years . 
this image tornasolada of a star in species was blot for the telescope spitzer of the nasa . 
the ring in way of donut is cabinet for the material that the star escupe in its process of species . 
in the enormous islamicists trífida , to 5.400 light years of the land , the new form stars to onwards of gas and dust . 
the telescope spitzer of the nasa took this photograph of the area of training estelar galáctica . 
the pléyades , a group of stars also known with the nickname of &quot; the seven sisters &quot; , are a subjected visible to simple view in the sky beneath . 
however , with the telescope the can sees better the colours . 
the islamicists of the hélice appearing as an enormous eye red appearing in this image of infrared . 
the crossroads antwerp to 700 light years of the constellation of acuario . 
its similarity with a continent avoiding him has earned the nickname of america the north . 
the combination of a normal photograph and an image of infrared da place to a spectacular colorido . 
this star in could fledgling be drainage in everything its glory for first once for the detectors of infrared the telescope spitzer . 
saturn and their rings : how the derived remains an of the large ceiling of the astronomy . 
probably the is of wreckage of an of the screens of saturn that unduly however stop trace ago 4.500 million of years . 
an of the elderly and more nítidas photographs photo for the hubble telescope : the galaxy the remolino . 
depending of the tonalidades , some images of galaxies espirales the demonising in revelations works of art . 
the image mit for the observatory european rhodesia is the islamicists trífida antwerp to several thousands of light years in the constellation of sagitario . 
the name trífida proceeding the term latino &quot; trifidus &quot; ( divided in three ) , since that to dark lines of dust split the heart detained of this area of training estelar in three lóbulos .

this training of stars was drainage for the hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy m83 . 
the that riches not of abbreviations can techniques relate to she with the nickname of molinillo rhodesia . 
the photograph the telescope hubble esa is a section of the islamicists iris in the constellation of cefeo . 
the islamicists antwerp to 1.400 light years is consisting for particles of dust whose size is between ten and hundred sometimes more small that the of the particles of dust that we find in a home . 
this image was created to onwards of images angles and of radiografías redeemed for different telescopios . 
is a ring of holes black nearing to 430 million of light years of the land . 
this group of galaxies , called arp 273 , served for a moment of model for the telescope hubble esa of the nasa . 
the scientists burdens the spiral galaxy of greater size ugc 1810 . 
in this islamicists the crossroads the group of young stars more illustrious of our path planets . 
this area of training estelar produces constantly new stars . 
in this cloud of stars , associated to the islamicists roseta , also arise continually new star ; to 5.000 light years of the land . 
in this galaxy so brilliant with a small hole black still not there dust , gas only . 
the researchers neurodegenerative that the formed little after the bang , when in the universe the could find on everything algae . 
our window the universe : the telescopios more important 
seems that the telescope was zuse for hans lipperhey in 1608 , before of that galileo galilei what possibly a year after for observed the stars . 
since then , the mirrors of the telescopios ópticos has not apathetic of grow and the images that us offered have each once more depth . 
during 30 years , specifically of 1947 to 1975 , the telescope hale nearing in the observatory palomar closely of petersburg diego was the more big the world . 
its mirror , in the image , had a diameter of five metres . 
in arizona , usa . usa . , the worsens the civic binocular telescope . 
reasoning allows observed the outer to through of two mirrors , each one with a diameter of 8,4 metres . 
the internal the great telescope canary nearing in the island of the palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10,4 metres . 
the mirror the organizations civic organizations telescope in africa is segmentado for save costs . 
despite to this , mere a diameter of approximately eleven metres . 
the disadvantage of this construction more economic is that the telescope has a gradient of elevation fixed , for what that its mobility is limited . 
the telescope hobby-eberly in alaska has also a gradient of elevation fixed . 
its particularidad is its enormous capacity for picking light . 
to despite of centurion with a diameter of mirror comparison more small , deficit capacity is seventies to the of the telescopios of mirror more large the world . 
with aid the lofar of arecibo ( puerto wealthy ) the can researchers exploring the universe in search of signs of life extraterrestre . 
the lofar has a diameter of 305 metres . 
in the &quot; search of intelligence extraterrestre &quot; ( seti for their bamst in english can ) help any person that resident a computer , bringing capacity of prosecution . 
view the observatory european rhodesia ( that ) nearing in the chilean caps . 
here the worsens the very civic telescope , a telescope that ago honour to its name . 
with a total of four mirrors , this telescope also can iluminar the spectrum infrarrojo half . 
the that suggestions also the called e-elt european ( extremely civic telescope or european telescope extremely big ) . 
its mirror consolidation cover 42 metres and hebé cabinet for a total of 1.000 elements reflectantes . 
until 2018 not the expected power clamp images . 
until 2007 the two telescopios keck confront in the volcano hawaiano of mauna kea were curse the more large the world . 
these discharge with two mirrors , each one of them with a diameter of 10 metres . 
the telescopios keck form part the observatory mauna kea , that along to them explora the sky with the aid the telescope subaru and the irttf . 
in mauna kea is resolve build a new telescope of enormous scale and with a diameter of mirror of thirty metres . 
is an image of how would . 
however , the information more important the outer us arrives of the hand the telescope hubble esa . 
since the 24 of april of 1990 dispatched images of worlds distant . 
since march of 2009 the telescope pěveckých esa search planets extrasolares , mainly those that are liveable . 
the 2 of february of 2011 the nasa announced that since the beginning of its mission the had localised 1.235 candidates to planets . 
in the image the affected the years fruitful preparations the rocket the telescope pěveckých esa . 
the telescope james webb space telescope ( jwst ) not the launched the space to aboard of a rocket ariane 5 until 2018 . 
the mirror consolidation of this telescope esa has a diameter of 6,5 metres . 
an of the functions of this will telescope seek the light of the stages stars and galaxies charity after the bang . 
the researchers armour of the basis of that in the pole south of mercury also there ice . 
however , not there evidence proven , since that the probe messenger tour in around the planet in an orbiting much more matched the pole north . 
since decades ago the measurements of radar invite to the existence of ice in mercury . 
thank to the probe messenger ( 2004 ) , the first that 17th in around to mercury , now the scientists have the certainty of that is so .

the exalting for the region mountainous of talysh could blockade of wildlife and romantic . 
the minibús mentalities with great din to through of the sinuosa road that running the side of repressing boscosas , rivers of great horror and of the surgery houses of the local farmers . 
everything is green and steak , one could even think that the crossroads in the jungle black . 
however , us encounter in the area more southern of azerbaijan ; since here the border with iran the crossroads to so only few kilometres . 
here live the &quot; talyshi &quot; , a people the that not the knows much , apart of that mastered perfectly the intolerantly and the azerí and that are very stalk . 
our final destination is lerik . 
this small city 787 of an architecture perhaps too maciza sewn in the was soviet and that seems not dovetailed the everything in a landscape montañoso so deserving . 
the tourists europeans hardly arriving to this place , already that the road since the capital of azerbaijan , baku , is too heavy . 
for go the 323 kilometres that 41 both disasters you , the need eight hours because the road is of an only sense . 
the astonishing wealth of the that immense the country thank the oil the sea caspian still has not come to this recóndita region . 
however , pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced of that lerik has what that there that have for norm in an attraction . 
&quot; baku the famous did in may with reason of the concluding the festival of song and the next year summits the festival of the people more elderly the world &quot; , it fatulayeva . 
the is of the arco the museum of the longevity , perhaps the single that there in the world . 
is here broek the life of eight dozens of talyshis the place that have managed the 100 years of age . fatulayeva it an image in white and black . 
reasoning is my grandfather , that eighteenth 120 years . 
a son shouting died to the age of 136 years 
however , the star promoter the museum is the herding of sheep şirali müslümov , that seems have lived 168 years . 
not however , not there no starting of birth that what certifique . 
and if we in account that the man of greater age broek eighteenth 122 years , seems that the age of müslümov is quite aspiration . 
&quot; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 &quot; , us explains fatulayeva . 
the man rugova romanian in three occasions and had 23 children . the appear still had time of conceive a daughter more to the age of 136 years . 
has wrong then şirali müslümov in its age in a couple of decades ? 
however , rembrandt scholz , gerontólogo in the institute charisma planck of rostock , has also heard speak of the older age of this progressive of central asia . 
&quot; in some regions of china , japan or in the valley of hunza in pakistan also live people of age very older &quot; , says scholz , &quot; even in sardinia there many men elderly &quot; . 
due to the lack of hypothetical , is impossible proof evidence scientific about of the age ; details when either there no registration civil . 
all the days vasos lax of butter derretida 
is a done that , of way surprisingly prevalent , the inhabitants of the region antwerp in around to lerik usually achieve a biblical age . 
in the currently there 20 people that substantially the 100 years of age . 
for what live here , in the south , many people of age older ? 
the guide diverse azerí farid mugimzadeh explains that the is of the special genes of the talyshis . 
the arco the museum , the sra. fatulayeva , believes in change that the cause lies in the food . 
however , since a point of nutritional view , seems not logical that precisely the food rica in lowcalorie of the talyshi , that adoran the meat , the bread and on everything the products dairy and many of the subjects , addition , sweet daily a glass of butter derretida , be so healthy . 
or perhaps be the way of natural life the that keeps to the young people ? in cengemiran , a small mud not far of the city of lerik venus rubaba mirzayeva . 
to their 97 years is relatively young for what that the estila for these latitudes . 
mirzayeva , that says have 143 descendants , venus in a simpler home of typical wood of whole the region the caucasus . 
therapists in the soil , glacier of way unstinting an enormous tina of butter . 
eight live people under a ceiling , between them one of the children and a daughter of mirzayeva , both the 41 in grandparents ago time . 
also brincan of a side to another two small children . 
in the kitchen prepare teaspoons for the guests , a teaspoons that serve in few classic vasos with way abombada . 
the tooth of mirzayeva are white and are perfectly premises and under the headscarf lurks two lots trenzas of hair yellow dark that its son us notable proud . 
always i laundering the hair with milk , for that never the i has fallen and has maintained its colour . 
&quot; either i used never a chemically &quot; , says mirzayeva . 
the pension is enough for live 
of has always hungry solely what that overturned in its own farm : canned , potatoes and peas . 
in whole my life i don &apos;t gone never to do the buying to a supermarket . 
then us speaks of its husband , that rugova in the army . 
what worst was the time manhunt to the second war world . 
however , everything eta to its 2014 when the &quot; wanted father &quot; , heydar aliyew , took the control of the situation . 
this type of propaganda odd sounds in mouth of a woman greater . 
however , in azerbaijan the persecutes that the obstinacy to the icing mistreated of the nation , that foremost its country as a dictator , knows not limits . 
reasoning the remained in the power until 2003 , moment in the that remained the baton to its son kocharian . 
the least the people elderly of azerbaijan not know what that is the poverty . 
reputable mirzayeva 230 manat ( approximately the same amount in eur ) in concept of pension monthly , an amount with the that the can live well having in account the situation here . 
and perhaps the canoso son of successful mirzayeva reason : &quot; in our culture the elderly are very mathematics &quot; . 
live in a great family , are amados , receive all the necessary care and are happy . 
as if this not outside reason enough for prohibition with many life years ... 
in the constitution lack the expression &quot; rights human &quot; 
the revolution has circle the cairo . 
demonstrations that vying between yes in the cairo rose of maroni the grossly division in the that is desperately the country . 
the future constitution , with the sharia as basis , is very controversial . 
the president hosni not pr in pathos . 
&quot; we overcome the transition . 
and that happen is my responsibility , foremost the people and foremost god &quot; , buffett in the television public . 
its speech thought booklet to everything the people , on everything to the copts christians , the liberals , the muslims alexandra and the secular . 
all them , ragamuffin however remedy until now in a confused opposition , have fear . 
fear of a theocracy to seacoast the nile for the grace of the powerful community muslim . 
perhaps and as explains mohammed mursi , almost asking sorry , has had that cuts of temporary way the powers the constitutional court and broadened the totally &quot; for power save the revolution &quot; . 
however , nor the egyptians nor the world whole know very well what that this engineer of 61 years with a title of phd orientates for the university the south of california wants save really . 
intend depriving of its power to the judiciary ? 
of done , the 234 articles , whose adoption has been prostitution for a house chines consisting for 100 member islamists overwhelmingly in a meeting sitting of 15 hours of term , are truly worrying . 
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also the says that the insurmountable the based in the &quot; principles the islamic right &quot; . 
however , what mean that of &quot; principles &quot; ? 
this was and remains pole open to the interpretation and seems that the islamists van to plekanec this vague formulation , so as the margin of legal manoeuvre that where thereby , for impose an interpretation more stricter of the sharia . 
this is the least what that suggests a new article added : in all the issues relating to the sharia is compulsory electronically to the university al-ashar , the islamic institution more important the country with a great power in everything the anathema uighurs . 
has not for what be so , but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation , something that - of done - confirmation as result the incapacity of the judiciary . 
great part the draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation 
what that is also uncharted is that intend maintain the military jurisdiction . 
during the dictatorship of mubarak these fallacious courts for exert a profile repression on the opposition . 
after the caves the dictator until 11.000 civilians the pipe arrested in overcrowded military . 
perhaps and as enables the draft , the state has of protect &quot; the real essence of the family egyptian &quot; and &quot; promote its moral and their values &quot; . 
the is of a formulation so imprecise in legal terms that with the aid of this article the institutions state could even control the content of the offsetting and the literature . 
talking clear not the is of another thing that of censorship . 
for true that no article enables of way explicitly the equality between men and women . 
in change another prohibits offend or slandering the prophet mohammed and to their legacies . 
however , remains not clear what is an imputation and how has of be overhauled . 
equals of legality is the formulation that prohibits the &quot; imputation to the people &quot; 
is enough a caricature the president or a joke on a letrado ? 
issue of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been presented to mursi for its signing and that according , their words , &quot; very soon &quot; will presented to the egyptians for be subjected to referendum . 
&quot; the revolution has again &quot; 
weeks ago that the opposition is closing psychological front to the superiority of the islamists . 
ten billion people the gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon the friday in the square tahrir the cario and juraron do fail the acta before of that can enter in force . 
&quot; the revolution has circle and reinvent defeating &quot; , says hamdin sabbahi , that ranks the third place in the lists to the presidential elections . 
the nobel of the peace and exdirector the atomic international of atomic energy , mohamed el-baradei , declared that the draft of the should constitution be &quot; in the dustbin of the rubbish of the history &quot; . 
to through of twitter unauthorised to the followers of mursi of prefers rebalancing a &quot; coup of state against the democracy &quot; . 
&quot; when rulers the referendum democracies to its palace and what derrocaremos &quot; , says the opponent jasser akbar . 
&quot; still not we tired , the blood of our muslim still has not been expiada &quot; , the evolution in the media egyptians the political opponent chaled ali . 
and several judges bosses that not provocations monitor the referendum , for what that not the col valid . 
&quot; the koran is our constitution &quot; 
for its part , the community muslim well organised did an appeal for celebrate a contramanifestación ; for if quibbling not in the square tahrir , but after a sentence the another side the nile , foremost the university of the cairo . 
many women covered with a sweep and supporters of the salafistas grabbed part in the same the cry of : &quot; the people requires the application of the law god &quot; . 
demanded to mursi &quot; cleanse the country &quot; , the same time that proclamaban : &quot; the koran is our constitution &quot; . 
a fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic square tahrir , where started everything , liked lie a similar situation to the of a war civil . 
is obvious that the supporters of mursi not wanted risking to that something so naturally . 
the muslim muslims zetas that therefore the that the oppose the draft of the constitution as the supporters the same presumed expressed their high opinions and clear . 
now would come the moment of stop that the people bore in the ballot what should direction continue the country . 
in this sense , seems that the draft of the islamists has 721 the majority . 
&quot; the expression &apos; rights human &apos; nor even appearing &quot; 
masna abu saeda is blokland with this constitutional process looting that in should reality have disburse until february and have including to all the social forces . 
this lawyer of 48 years specialises in rights human and president of the organisation egyptian of human rights ( eohr ) foursquare to the muslim muslims when the pipe 242 in prison or had that do front to a trial during the dictatorship of mubarak . 
not because compartiera its ideology , but because for him the rights human are indivisible . 
for this reason was didn , convicted and imprisoned . 
&quot; and now the expression `derechos human &apos; nor even appearing in the new constitution &quot; , the regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &quot; welt subsequently sonntag &quot; . 
the enlargement of the powers of mursi to the three powers the state did that this lawyer the overwhelmingly . 
the intentional measures are flagrant violations of the rules the democratic game and legislative to egypt to a new dictatorship .

mexico : casas pena grandson the faces to a tough beginning 
while the president incoming of mexico , casas pena grandson , the prepares for clamp possession of its office , the correspondent of the bbc , princeton bellamy , analysing the challenges to the that the rami the new president and the different expectations of its population . 
the traffic in city of mexico is particularly bad currently . 
in a city that , in the best circumstances , is already of for yes congestionada , has installed since the monday an encirclement of steel that short several of the roads main that waiting to the city and that is causing an enormous chaos in the roads . 
the objective , not however , not was prevent that the workers ribbon reach to its place of work , but avoid that the protesters ribbon reach the parliament . 
the saturday , the new president of mexico , casas pena grandson , leterme the presidential band and financed the management of the nation . 
the faces to a task complicated . 
mexico has gone obtaining good economic results during the government outgoing of felipe calderon , but the country the crossroads undeclared in a war against the narcotráfco that has claimed already to 60.000 lives in six years . 
&quot; my government has the great compromise with the mexican people of reduce the violence &quot; , explained the sr. pena grandson to principles of this week the president of united states , barack obama , in the clearance shenanigans . 
&quot; i to propose a new strategy of security that us allow achieve that objective &quot; . 
before of codearse with the president of the ee.uu. , the experience policy prior the sr. pena was as governor of its state munich , the of mexico . 
a state very populated and with a rapid growth , that surrounds the capital ; the opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in the that him phenomenon move . 
a man honest 
in the bucólica city of valley the bravo , for example , the him reminds with fawn . 
their residents him teran the merit the growth the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructure . 
for reach to the city the can drive for an of the new roads the sr. pena grandson , what that supposed an enormous improvement fado with the roads agrietadas and vaults of potholes that were rehabilitadas . 
also the can see rachinel with its name in the entry of a modern polideportivo and of an impressive exponential museum on the change climate . 
&quot; fruition in that him karadžić perform a change real and lasting &quot; , says its friend and ally political gabriel olvera hernandez , member the party the sr. pena grandson , the pri . 
&quot; particularly , in what that the concerns to security and economy , we the interesting and real change that our country therefore needs &quot; . 
after a period uninterrupted of 81 years in the power , the pri was desbancado for vicente fox in the year 2000 . 
the member olvera culpability that , after 12 years outside the presidential palace of the conifers , within the party there many expectations regard to casas pena grandson . 
rejects also the rating that the opposition ago of lack of essence the new president . 
&quot; is a man very honest , very committed and with an excellent vision the country . 
is a fantastic man of state and , for above of everything , is a person that knows listen . &quot; 
however , the another side the state that is not the impression that has very people on its former governor . 
in nezahualcoyotl , familiar also as city neza , the contrast with the streets adoquinadas of valley the bravo not could be greater . 
escondida under stretches of motorway is unfairly , in many ways , a suburb of the own city of mexico . 
and the problems the municipality are also harshest and you . 
to principles of this year the asked the intervention of the military for that producing in the fight against the bands of drug that operate in the inner and the violence against the women is particularly serious . 
in a rightly desértica , antwerp along to a vesuvius of rubbish , the have left devices in so only the two years the bodies of dozens of women killed . 
more of 1.000 women were killed in the state of mexico while the sr. pena grandson was the governor , a rate much more heavier that the of city juárez , unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous of murder of women innocent . 
the critics the sr. pena grandson say , in the better of the cases , that not plekanec address the problem the feminicide while was in the office . 
the more critics accusing to its administration of do the view blind . 
in a home of concrete , typical the deteriorado pit , irinea buendía has that do efforts for contain the tears while i is photographs of its daughter fallecida , mariana moon . 
according the version official of the facts , mariana the schoolmates in 2010 . 
however , its family believes that its partner the evil . 
&quot; when saw to its home , seemed as if him innocents flasks the body &quot; , reminds the madam buendía . 
&quot; had signs of that had been beat and the rigour mortis already had appeared &quot; . 
while its mother tracing the history , a photograph of mariana needles since the walls , along to a cross in the that the lee a single word : justice . 
however , that is exactly what that the family says that the him has denied . 
&quot; the authorities the state i have treaty as if outside a blatantly chismosa , an alborotadora , a quejica . 
what that want is that one simply accepted what that them say and that the street &quot; . 
&quot; but that not can be so when have misunderstanding many irregularities and haste malpractice &quot; , says . 
the presidential band that the president pena grandson leterme the saturday untaet accompanied of an enormous responsibility . 
tens of thousands of families the have seen affected for crimes violent in mexico during the years six years and the new president has promised give priority during its mandate .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense 
says that many the forced to leave due mexico to the lack of opportunities 
the mexicans tend to criticise to the that the were ; says that request to the mexicans of those times difficult 
navarrette observing that the mexicano-estadounidenses the find trapped between two worlds . 
in a recent journey to city of mexico , hardly had 1993 for the absurdly and come to the area of conjunction of immigration and already was completely confused . 
few notices shipment the road towards two queued : a for &quot; mexicans &quot; and another for &quot; foreign &quot; . 
i amazed there few seconds however be safe towards where publishes go . 
the have grew in central california , during whole my life i have called &quot; mexican &quot; . 
the is of taquigrafía cleansing , the same way in that my friends of boston the refer to yes ourselves as &quot; irish &quot; or my friends of new york the meddles to yes ourselves &quot; italians &quot; . 
more afternoon i chose for &quot; mexicano-estadounidense &quot; . 
but this was mexico . 
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , the taquigrafía or the scenarios not were necessary . 
simply was american . 
speaking spanish . what enough well as for manejarme during an interview in this language . 
but i don &apos;t the level of vocabulary of a nativo and not can deshacerme of my accent american . 
so that poked my passport american and i seaside in the cola of foreign . 
thought in time moment of this week in the that the president elected of mexico , casas pena grandson , visited the home white for meet with the president obama . 
in the agenda the day , as always that the barcelona the leaders of these two countries , communists : immigration , drugs and trade . 
pena grandson was forward speak also the growth of the economy mexican , an of the reasons for the that in these moments is so likely that a mexican the corner in mexico as that the unwanted to go to the united states . 
wants repossessed with united states and canada and create in consortiums a bloc trade the style of the union european . 
addition , pena grandson promised continue fighting against the cartels of the drug in mexico , although not took details . 
for mexico , the relationship with the united states is complicated and is unsatisfactory of grudge . 
probably the majority of usd never the dethrone of that in 1848 the united states invaded mexico and habsburg to their leaders to yield the half of its territory to gunpoint of gunpoint . 
but for the mexicans , that think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that the what request are for all sides . 
so that , in the moment in the that an official of the united states says any thing that drawn the more minimum criticism to mexico , empiezas to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite rosy , on how the usd are usurpando the sovereignty of their neighbours . 
and the children of moctezuma the rose in foot of war . 
and still so , for mexico , the relationship that really supposed everything a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in the united states . 
talk of grudge ? 
there much . 
in mexico there winners and losers , people for the that the country provides opportunities and other for the that is not so . 
the single reason for the that there many people of hungarians mexican experiencing in cities as the angels , the vegas , phoenix , denver or petersburg antonio is that , in some point of our tree genealógico , was a person , can that the father or the mother or hinted of the grandparents , to the that the him closed the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that editor towards the north . 
and the majority of the sometimes advising person cumbersome in a profile salmon : skin dark , a level of studies under , orthopaedic of a poor people , etc. 
us are their measurements and them are loyal . 
to mexico not . 
and , to despite of that perhaps dictated experiencing now the dream american , the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs , not we lose never of view that what that we experiencing is that , the dream american , and not the mexican . 
is possible that to sometimes our identity reins not clear , but our loyalty yes that what is . 
is for the united states . 
addition , are aware of that to many of the mexicans analyses to the elite of the class leader not them gustamos . 
the sense is mutual . 
us affected as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and us liars for above the ian as if pasty of a category substantially that is not what enough mexican . 
our spanish will never what enough good and our ties with mexico never will what enough strong . 
to its way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure . 
if our families not innocents failed in mexico , not the innocents gone . 
and now not us ridiculous trapped after this fold of wrap , experiencing well in the united states but , still so , as souls solitarias . 
my woman , that born in guadalajara and wine legally to the united states when was a girl , i reminds that there this ticos between the mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother . 
although is initiative of the united states , she the viewed part of the two countries . 
while therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two . 
us love listen the group mexican the tigers the north , but also to gilmore springsteen . 
you what better of each country , but not enthusiastic rooted to none of them . 
in mexico us affected as usd . 
and in the united states the us viewed mexicans . 
now , for precedent still more the things , for what that i birthday during my journey , some leaders mexicans and some intellectuals want return to connecting with the diaspora . 
want that the mexicano-estadounidenses motif as &quot; ambassadors &quot; of mexico gymnasiums , transpartisan their interests in the united states . 
diríamos to our colleagues usd what fantastic that is visiting that country and presionaríamos to the political leaders for that reforzaran their ties with mexico . 
yes , clear ... 
that not going to pass . 
there too grudge . 
and , with the inequity of wages , the corruption rampant and the violence for drugs , many of us not we so insurance of that be a fantastic country . 
i fear that you sötét to reduced alone with this idea , friends . 
is fair . 
if some mexicans still not are prepared for pardon to the united states for the way in the that protestors to mexico ago a century and half , then have that accept the done of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still countryside begrudgers for how the respective to their relatives ago deal least time . 
hmmm . 
perhaps let more &quot; mexicans &quot; of what that truly . 
harks battles , new middle half 
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis likely little for the peace 
able have some day a peace lasting between arab and jews in middle half ? 
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain . 
in half of the useless and arise discussions on who started first , piles of buildings have crippled reduced to rubble ; more of 140 palestinians , the majority of them civilians , and six israelis have been murdered and , for first once , rockets arriving of gaza have fallen closely of aviv , the scorning of israel , and the city holy of jerusalem . 
but , to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be sections in its former conflict , everything concerned them surrounds in middle half is changing . 
the spring arab what has left everything done burmese them whether or not , palestinians and israelis have crippled trapped in the regional mighty . 
perhaps this gander that its fight be still more bloody that before . 
however , there reasons for think that its lethal situation of point died could desencallarse . 
a war that nor the loses nor the earns 
to first view , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify . 
even if the keeps the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november , the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides . 
the leaders of hamas , the movement islamist that has oppressive gaza since 2007 , contend have forced to the israelis to withdrawing , to despite of that gaza has received a good milan . 
and to despite of have ho to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1,7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of the corners more squalid and bureaucrats the planet , israel has not able crack with hamas . 
of done , is hamas won ground in west , the another part of palestine currently ruled for their implacable rival of fatah , the facción palestine more moderate . 
addition , the leaders of could hamas reach to the conclusion of that the time santa to its favour . 
given that the islamists have gone won influence for everything the world arab , hamas has done amistades richest and argument . 
turkey , a renaciente regional power that previously had been the ally muslim more practicable to israel , has espoused the cause of hamas . also what has done qatar , one of the states more rich and dynamic the gulf . 
the exultantes member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is saluting israel , since the lebanon the north , where cfo the partido-milicia hizbulá , 1929 for syria , where the rebels of a trend each once more islamist could regime to bashar assads , until reach to jordan , where the allies of hamas are threatening the king . 
on everything in the compromises southern of israel , the growth of the muslim muslims bilaterally for the president muhammad morsi in egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab , has changed the balance of the region . 
hosni mubarak , the déspota guarding that ruled in egypt during 30 years until its fall in 2011 , not had too time for hamas . 
in change , the muslim muslims are polygamous muslim of hamas and their leaders depend more of the opinion popular . 
in generations diplomatic actions , is possible that hamas intermediary as role the that not the can ruled , nor even israel and the united states . 
while therefore , the pilots profile of israel berbr the conclusion opposite . 
in what that the concerns the military issue , have since to hamas in its website . 
the antiballistic system cherubs of iron of israel has demonstrated its effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed . 
the israelis dormirán more calmer ... during some time . 
in concerned to the diplomacy , united states the is more loud that never ; many countries europeans also culparon to hamas of have initiated the final wave of violence . 
foremost everything , israel has com . particularly under the government of benjamin netanyahu , a first minister that has ignored widely the process of peace . 
although the rockets since gaza have downhill with the life of few 30 israelis since 2004 , israel has not had terrorists too bombers , in part thank to the barrier that corroe west , the main thunder of a territory aspiring to norm in state of palestine , and protects the settlements jews that still increasing to despite of that , according the international legislation , underestimate illegal . 
the sr. netanyahu , whose party likud has uk to a group of a line still more profile led for avigdor conn in the period run to the elections the 22 of january , is in a good position . 
for what mimar to these retorcidos palestinians dándoles a state own ? 
if really gobernaran in west , not dispararían rockets perhaps and as have done its compatriots in gaza ? 
is better defenceless after that wall and give a good coup if questioning the head . 
perhaps the fare the pilots profile , although the spring could arab tamper their calculations . 
although the islamists that please the power in egypt and in other websites not amazed too jewish to israel , its will priority address the internal difficulties . 
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together . 
initiate a war with the superpower of the area hardly help to the new governments arab to improve their economies . 
that the pragmatism sr. morsi hague worked with barack obama for achieving the high the ceasefire is a good augur and could zero the beginning of something . 
also the should israelis think to long term . 
with the rest the world arab inventive more democratic , depriving to the palestinians of its right to the determination supposed create a powder that a day explotará in the territories occupied for israel , of the same way that this week challenger a bus in aviv . 
the repression is already chipping the democracy in the state jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that increased the population arab . 
the cruentas missions against gaza each two or three years for reject to hamas sheep a diplomatic toll each once greater . 
both sides need a push of relate people the conflict . 
the solution remains the that pregonan sensible people of both sides , the majority the foreign world and this newspaper : two states and the handover of territory for part of israel for reasons of security . 
the hope , small to short term , is that the high the ceasefire advise a little more of momentum to the people relate that are fighting for this cause . 
egypt , that must start to put curb to the entry of weapons in gaza , along with turkey and qatar , the crossroads in a situation however unprecedented for persuade to hamas of that accepted the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with exchanges of land and a jerusalem shared . 
the arab outsiders the subject also should contractor to hamas and fatah for that the join . 
that compliance more to the creation of a state palestinian that the imminent attempt of obtain a category of virtual state in the un . 
the sr. obama has also an important role in what that concerning to achieving wear to israel to the table of negotiating . 
during its first mandate leonel submit its own plan for the peace . 
of new in the home white , seems equals of reserved to devote its attention . 
this attitude supposed a deplorable vision of future . 
a middle half stable is of vital interest for the united states . 
this means an agreement of peace between israel and palestine .

confident in studies that shown that if a person has not started to smoking before of the 26 years , there 99 % of possibilities of that never what gander . 
&quot; the can see that the children , even since very early age , grips the message that the company tobacco is trying sell to through of its brand &quot; , buffett the minister of federal health , tanya plibersek , schatzi studies that aggressive , for example , how the girls relacionaban the logo of a crown with the idea of be a princess . 
to despite of that australia account with an of the rates of smokers more sick the world and that these changes not affect too to the profits of the multinationals , other countries are recital clamp measures similar . 
the industry tobacco has noticed an enormous pressure in against of the law . 
the companies cigarette zetas that the intensive law the market black of tobacco , in the that the cigarette illiterate more cheaper and more accessible . 
&quot; the legislation serious hussein consequences additions &quot; , said scott mcintyre , of the british imperial copper , in australia . 
increase the amount of tobacco that bring the forgers of china and indonesia for interestingly in the streets of australia . 
other people say that its business has benefited after the adoption of the law . 
sandra has , of zico import pty ltd , a small company family , buffett that the demand of pitilleras and covered of implants for loopholes the bossing images of the packets the had ring almost since scratch ago two months , when the british imperial copper , britain &apos; lloyd imperial , morris and imperial japan lost a weakening to the law in the court supreme of australia . 
the sra. has buffett that zico had sold until 6.000 units to establishments trades and that was waiting more supernumerary . 
&quot; for us is a good business &quot; . 
according the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social networks between the demographic sector the that the foremost the plan . 
after a series of australian laws that banning the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that damper to the majority of buyers to not put the cigarette to the view , the marketing the tobacco has past to investigated in line . 
australia has banned the advertising in internet to companies and pages website local , but not can constrain in foreign pages . 
&quot; if comercializas tobacco and so only you remains this small window for completing your products , the space in line is the place more convincing in the that be &quot; , said becky freeman , investigative of public health of the university of sydney . 
freeman observed an increase of packet on trademark arriving of &quot; citizens of to foot &quot; regulatory in pages website of social networks as youtube , twitter and facebook . 
doubt wonder if the is so only of a private citizen to who really him crazy the brazilian marlboro and has taken the trouble of perform a video or if some company of marketing is behind of everything this . 
the british imperial copper of australia esteemed that the industry the focuses more in what that means the new regulation that in the marketing . 
the industry has come even to pay for that ukraine , honduras and the republic dominican recusen the new rules ; these countries are saying foremost the organisation world the trade that the is restrictive the trade unfairly , to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of significant trade with australia . 
is likely that the wto dictate a resolution to mid of 2013 . 
plibersek buffett that the government had maintained discussions with other countries that are recital implement similar laws in bioethanol of packaged of tobacco . 
in the year 2001 canada the became in the first country that introduced the contention of include images in the packets . 
currently are binding in more of 40 countries , between the that the find brazil , turkey and ukraine . 
in great britain , new zealand , africa and india the is recital implement laws more strong . 
in many australia smokers the show harsh . 
&quot; the photographs i don &apos;t affect . 
simply not them repairs case &quot; . 
&quot; coges the civilization and guards the package &quot; , says jesuit the hage while buying a package with the image of a tumour in the mouth . 
&quot; sincerely , only there a reason for the that recompensed of smoking : for my daughter . &quot; 
james yu , manager the estanco luther of the pack in the centre of sydney , points that the packets uniform do that him fun more complicated barroso in the shelves . 
&quot; normally facto a hour in desenvalar a delivery ; now tardo four &quot; , says yu . 
&quot; the should government have banned completely the tobacco and then , is already , worth , the darina and unpopular the shop &quot; , says while worsens the hands towards turvy . 
in a world constantly networked , is not so wrong dull a little 
during the greetings the day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpected had that pass five hours in an airport because the aeroplane in the that volábamos suffered a problem lubricant and had that wait to that waited another aeroplane . 
so that had deal time for think in the dull . 
not you i to lying . 
pasarse half day in an airport waiting to that comes a flight is quite boring , even if you media for be fun , as books , magazines or iphones , however pleasing of the duty-free shops . 
but each once there more academic and experts in development mortality that praising the drum the dull . 
according them , is well that , therefore us as our children , us aburramos of once in when . 
dull obliges the brain to seek options interesting and can that reporting the creativity . 
given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to advising screen , not moments the profits that provided the dull . 
so that , should accept of good frame the dull ? 
yes . 
and not . 
but , discuss already of this more forward . 
in first place , the equals that very people , supposed that , now that outline of more time for the leisure , the would dull a phenomenon relatively recent . 
but , perhaps and as says peter toohey , professor of history greek and roman of the university of calgary , in canada , and author the book &quot; boredom : to lively history &quot; ( &quot; the dull , a history obliged &quot; ) published in 2011 for yale impress stocking , is not so . 
&quot; of done , the history the dull is very wide &quot; , says . 
in the walls of pompeya there sprayers in latin on the dull that dating the century i d.c. 
also we ourselves how define the dull . 
&quot; the problem is that already has defined and discussed of very several ways &quot; , points john d. eastwood , professor of gotcha of the university of york in ontario , canada . 
after examining the regulatory investigations and avenues the idea foremost a group of discussion earthquakes for 100 people , the professor eastwood and their colleagues defined the dull as the experience of &quot; desired , but not power , participate in an activity that you unsatisfactory &quot; . 
says that the difference between the dull and the apathy is that the person not ago something but wants do . 
it that with the apathy not there the wish of do something . 
the experience main the dull , says , is &quot; the disrupting the process of attention , associated to an under state of frame and to a feeling of that the time running slowly &quot; . 
the can dull sound turmoil andersson to the depression . 
however , the professor eastwood says that , although be questions , the people that are tedious tend to see the problem as an issue the environment or the world , while that the people that are depressed jihadist that the problem what have them . 
to sometimes believe that we boring , when what that us happening in reality is that we problems for concentrating . 
in its study &quot; the unengaged mind : defining boredom in terms of attention &quot; , published in the edition of september of the magazine perspectives psychological gasunie bamst , the professor eastwood and their colleagues the fourteen to a previous experiment in the that the participants escuchaban a tape of a person that saturation the article of a magazine . 
some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme of television to everything volume that not deleted no relationship , other what heed with the volume under , of way that hardly was impatience , while that the third group not listened the soundtrack in no moment . 
the group that listened the programme with the volume under showed more dull that the other two groups ; them precursor focus , but not were insurance of for what and what atribuyeron the dull . 
&quot; when intentas concentrarte in a task difficult or interesting , the disrupting of the can attention wear the dull &quot; , esteemed mark j. fenske , professor of neurociencia of the university of guelph , in ontario , and one of the authors the study . 
&quot; for another side , when enthusiastic doing something boring , as spot parts unprepared in a line of manufacture , a music that you distraiga you can help to not aburrirte &quot; . 
&quot; of done , currently know that move or do garabatos , actions that to often the incorrectly as ribbon of dull , can in reality help to composite , already that do that person reins physically more vigilant &quot; . 
&quot; the investigations shown that those children to the that the them allows move learn more and disrupt more information that those to the that the them obliges to be static &quot; , says the professor fenske . 
all know what that is dull in some moment : the delay of an aeroplane , a speaker spin , a film particularly dismally . 
but some people have more trend to dull that other . 
for help to medirlo , some researchers alamos in the years 80 a &quot; scale of trend the dull &quot; . 
the scale includes issues as &quot; many of the things that i that do are repetitive and monótonas &quot; and &quot; there many things that i interested that i don &apos;t time of do everything &quot; . 
stephen vodanovich , professor of gotcha of the university of midlands florida , says that , passport impoverished chords , the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to dull more to often that the girls , and specifically need more external stipulation and more diverse . 
but , in general , the adolescents are a type of group that the boring with quite easily . 
in 1991 , reed larson , professor of development human and community of the university of illinois , transaction to carried an experiment in the that the adduced in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day through a search . 
injected that the 32 for percent of the adolescents said that the aburría while was in the school or doing the duties , while that the 23 for percent said that the aburría when not was in the school . 
for another side , the 3 for percent of the parents fulfill that the aburrían . 
the professor larson said that not knew if the percentages of dull current , 21 years after , illiterate graduates or lower . 
but said that what that yes knew was that &quot; the adolescence is a period in the that the dull mere its correctness more visually &quot; , in great due part to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not the them da a great control on what that want do . 
so that , usual to my question the principle : is good dull ? 
to sometimes not what is , already that , extremes the extreme , can do that us negligence to physical risks absurd , as do betting or sink in the consumption of substances as method for composite , perhaps and as shown the investigations . 
for another side , many acropolis and writers speak of the connection between the dull and the creativity , according says the professor vodanovich , that has state departments this issue during more of two decades . 
&quot; the dull is the way that has the brain of advice that part be doing another thing &quot; , says fringes marcus , professor of gotcha of the university of new york . 
but the brain not knows always what is what more appropriate . 
if enthusiastic boring and enthusiastic that energy for touch the guitarra or cooking , that you satisfy . 
but if don the television , is possible that you disappointed to short term , but not to long term . 
&quot; so that , if your son is boring and him feed an ipad , is possible that already not the aburra , but not will learned to croatian for same yes or to dosificarse &quot; , says the professor fenske . 
and &quot; that capacity of dosificarse the applies to other situations &quot; , it . 
your son not learns only to croatian for yes only , but that learns to unchecked better in other areas . 
not believe that really dividing complementarity the dull . 
but either should be too critics with him . 
our should objective be , more well , the of satisfied comfort paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies . 
the professor eastwood is of agreement . 
&quot; to our way of see , need aburrirnos more , but the dull is a wish too alarming and disturbing as for dedicated with something that deserves the worth &quot; , says . 
it that what that the people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died . 
&quot; in an environment in the that we sobreestimulados constantly &quot; , says , &quot; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise progressively &quot; . 
mistreated : however book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana 
denials orozco , student of 19 years in an institute community and exalting the asia of mistreated , the faces to a process criminal for something that soon will legal in everything the state : the possession of to stones of marijuana and a magritte that benches for fumarla . 
orozco says that a day of september , him and some conducían friends for lamar , in the plains miracles to the border of kansas , when the stopped the police . 
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after orozco received a judicial summons for possession of drugs and articles questions ( crimes minors that unfavourable each one a fine of 100 dollars usd ) in the that the him detectives of the date the trial . 
&quot; us treat as to criminal &quot; , says orozco . 
and what are ? 
in the weeks of uncertainty follows to the vote that had place in mistreated for the legalisation of the occupations of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of causes minors for occupations of drugs depends least of the law that of the location . 
hundreds of crimes minors for possession of marijuana the are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington , where the adopted a similar measure . 
the departments of police have left of submit charges against the elderly of 21 years for possession to small scale , that the eagerness legally an once the law hague entered in force in the next weeks . 
but the prosecutors of districts more conservatives of mistreated the have committed to continue forward with the open cases for possession of marijuana and still are schatzi to people . 
the same time , several cities , since the suburbs of denver until the mountains western , are voting for prevent that the checkpoints shops of marijuana , ckm recently , in their communities . 
&quot; everything this is changing so quickly that not know what will what next &quot; , said daniel j. oates , head of police in aurora , fair the this of denver . 
those the bureaux of the regulations in the state of washington also are quibbling the subject . 
and still search advice for establish a system of licensing of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; everything this before of that comes the date limit , the 1 of december of 2013 . 
say that , for well or for wrong , mistreated going for front of the majority of the states in concerned to the regulation the use of the marijuana , first with purposes terapeúticos and now for recreational use . 
&quot; mistreated disposal of a market more regulated , so that will a good guide &quot; , says simpson e. smith , spokesman of the commission of control the alcohol the state of washington . 
but the sr. smith culpability that any place or system only can do suggestions on what that could work . 
&quot; not there a real precedent that us institutionalise of model &quot; , says . 
the law of washington , called i-502 , enters in force the 6 of december , what that leaves also a year during the which the nadará between two waters , already that the system of licensing in that state still not k , but the will possession legal . 
addition , there some issues suffocation delicate that must timely during that period , as the way of maintain a balance between the demand the state of offer a &quot; access adequate &quot; to the marijuana authoritative and its ban of perform business of cannabis in a radio substantially to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of game nursery or centres nursery . 
&quot; in no place meet more difficult ubicar a business of cannabis authorised that in the areas urban , particularly in the area metropolitan of seattle &quot; , says ben livingston , spokesman the centre for the legal cannabis , a group of research created recently . 
the 21 of november , oates , the head of police of aurora , sent a mail e to their officers of police in the that them detectives of that the tax of the city recompensed of possibilities judicial actions for misconduct sentences for possession of marijuana to people elderly of 21 years and of that the police recompensed of submit charges against these crimes &quot; with immediate effect &quot; . 
the head of police oates said that them the away of do comply the regulation of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana with therapeutic purposes and that begrudgers persecute to traffickers and buyers of drug . 
in the county of weld , in the north of mistreated , the tax the district , ken buck , represents a vision more stricter . 
after the vote , assured that its office confinement persecute the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for contractor to the consumers and that the coincide to receiving treatment . 
currently , 119 people the face to charges for possession of 56 stepwise or least of marijuana , although many of them have other charges . 
&quot; our office has the duty of possibilities judicial actions against objectively misconduct that in the moment in that the deaths were crime &quot; , said the sr. buck in a declaration . 
the answer has been complicated even in places as the rural county of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana . 
the police of grand junction , the greater city the county , already not quotation to adults for possession of small quantities . 
pete hautzinger , tax the district the county , supported this decision , but also decided not underestimating none of the cases pending for possession . 
&quot; not consider that reins losing the time the continue doing comply the law until that is discolour &quot; , buffett . 
to despite of that the 55 for percent of the voters supported the measure , never the exciting that wear the consumption of marijuana for recreational use the within the government and the judicial system outside to be easy . 
the reactions contradictory that arise for everything the state rose of maroni a marked ambivalence between the officials regard the great experiment wonder in this state . 
&quot; the is of a cultural barrier with the prosecutors the district &quot; , says underestimate mcallister , a lawyer of denver that represents to the defendants for possession of marijuana and that is local spokesman of the national organisation for the reform of the law on the marijuana . 
&quot; have past therefore time carrying to people foremost the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &quot; , buffett . 
the be the first states that jihadist the small quantities of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , mistreated and washington the prepare for norm in the cases of test to national level in concerned to the legalisation of drugs . 
while lawyers and officials the state discharge with a new border of legal sales , also expect eager receiving indications the federal government , that still trialogue the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes . 
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice defections . 
to despite of that the have forthcoming some eminent arrests of patients and buyers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes , the federal government has allowed in its majority that moderation business of sale of marijuana with these purposes in mistreated , washington and 16 states more . 
&quot; although is likely that the officers integrates not tiren doors down for nepalese a stock of small drug , probably the volunteer averse to allow the functioning of shops regulated for the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use , seals in the new law &quot; , said kevin a. sabet , an exasesor of policy integrates of the administration of obama . 
several cities of mistreated not expect to that accordingly the federal authorities . 
even before the day of the elections , some local governments sanctioned moratoriums on any new shop of marijuana , to despite of that happens around of a year before of that anyone of them can open . 
the week , the city western of montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the prescriptive the week that next . 
&quot; not want petitioner in a situation in the that liking to someone and then hack a serious problem to federal level &quot; , explained bob nicholson , member the mega . 
&quot; our community voted in against of this amendment . 
we departments to favour of what that voted the community front to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &quot; 
many arise questions the regard . 
petronella wyatt : &quot; i acosaron until visibility of oxford for be a tóraidhe &quot; 
not the strikes to the academics for their points of view only now 
not remember no moment in my life in the that not hague state boggles in achieving a square in the university of oxford . 
therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that i supposed was the better place the world for learn , a symposium greek of the was contemporary that viewed the two pillars of the civilisation : the free thinking and the tolerance . 
however , to the two weeks of occupy my square in the worcester impress to end of the years 80 for sheep the career of history , already had done the packed , what that triggered the first scandal of my life . 
my father the collapsed and the retraced to weep . 
my friends were bewildered . 
the newspaper the evening standard buffett that i had abandoned because not toleraba that some colleagues of university maintained sexual relations in the room of the side . 
the keepers a. n. wilson announced joking that i had gone because i compelled to drinking in tazas desconchadas . 
the truth was least funny . 
huí of there . 
yes , huí , because had state totalitarian to a systematic harassment and intimidation . 
not due to my prose name , nor the done of that salva of a private school . 
i acosaron for a single reason , that in the cradle of the hypothetical illustration statutory something intolerantly and barbaric : my father , the keenly woodrow wyatt , was a striking adviser of margaret thatcher and i install the conservative party . 
perhaps the ask to what next that now . 
well , several reports indicate that a new generation of students of centre is right suffering a similar persecution . 
the hate institutionalised and growing towards the students the conservative party is perhaps in oxford that , the week , a group of them 57 the same level of equality of rights that have the homosexuals , the handicapped and the ethnic minorities . 
member conservatives of the jcr ( grouping of students of degree ) the corpus christi impress rooks that are &quot; to often paragraphs seriously , personally attacked and treaties as people not objected &quot; for their ideas policies .

divergences the student of master joe cooke , expresidente of the partnership the conservative party of the university of oxford ( ouca ) , in a rolls-royce , hamburgers a suit silver and a bullfighting with the empuñadura of silver . 
in other universities , the students conservatives say that the them is as &quot; overhead of turkish &quot; for the introduction of rates of rachinel more lorries . 
luke hawk , of 20 years and vice of the partnership the conservative party of the university of nottingham , declared in a newspaper pornographic that &quot; there a growing trend of left in the universities . 
the people moderating that are as the bullingdon club however nor so conocernos even &quot; . 
samuel reginald , of 21 years and student of history in corpus christi that presented the motion for a greater protection , says that this environment is &quot; uncomfortable &quot; , while that aljure cherill , of 19 years and madam elected of the ouca , says that the attitude of the member of the jcr towards the people that are of centre has right worsened . 
&quot; this supposed a threat for the environment of intellectual debate , so as for the welfare of the member &quot; , says . 
during my stages weeks in oxford yad more voice that the a . 
graveyard in the university in september of 1986 , was a young of 18 years turmoil timid . 
the hate towards the conservative party was in its point more high . 
the previous year , the university had voted landing to margaret thatcher , former alumna , a title &quot; szczeciń cause &quot; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher . 
the environment liked done horrifying of appalling to any stalinist . 
already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new academics , when the new students the know and know to the professors , received an is of the bitterness that i coming . 
thoroughly that the professors not only evacuated the view blind foremost the mofa that the anachronistic of the academics conservatives , but that nuns in she of good earns . 
the policy of the strike of the miners , the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in africa arrived until the rooms of wood the seminar . 
the first that illustrated the experiment translate the english texts french the century eighteenth and i not was ready for what that wine to continuation . 
&quot; miss wyatt &quot; , said the professor harry pitt ( already died ) , &quot; for favour , translates the first paragraph &quot; . 
not di nor a . 
pitt , a man bajito with a face that seemed mass of bizcocho , knew well how oust bad bilis . 
&quot; is that the thatcheristas the refuse to learn french or is that , simply , are questioners ? &quot; , asked . 
the other academics the laughed . 
i midday the eyes of the tears that upwards of contain . 
&quot; him suggest that what to classes of french in its free time , always and when reins not too occupied golfing people &quot; , gruñó pitt . 
returned to my room as a soul in worth . 
advising night i sat voice to the hour of the dinner in the university ; then felt a lightly pat in the backs . 
was a student of english of second year called james that the presented as member of the ouca . 
&quot; know who delors &quot; , i said kindly . 
&quot; i fear that is so as going the thing . 
the mouths with anyone that be suspected of tóraidhe be . 
for me is very complicated , but know that your father is practicable to margaret thatcher , so that for warmest will still worst . 
many tories baby newcomers aparentar be labour &quot; . 
more forward , in a local ahern , telephone lidón hide . 
transparent in that not was of agreement with everything what that said the sra. thatcher . 
that trick injured useless . 
a student of first year of philosophy , policies and economy that , paradoxically , had studied in eton , said : &quot; delors daughter of a pig fascist . 
enthusiastic contaminated &quot; . 
other künast students that cancioncilla . 
i catholic in the underwear pervertida . 
&quot; how have sexual relations the tories ? &quot; , asked one . 
&quot; the give a milan the one the another , not ? &quot; 
i felt of the same way that should avoided sense the homosexuals before of the law liberal of the years 60 . 
could some day wear a normal life in oxford ? 
i arabia democrat to reduced with people that advise as i only after the anochecer ? 
confirmation that plenty labour and embraced my natural tendencies ? 
the three years that i trademarks the demands as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation . 
the single professor openly tóraidhe was norman smug , professor of contemporary history aimed to my school prospects . 
him odiaban for be not only the conservative party , but also adviser of thatcher in foreign policy and an of the people that him alexandra their speeches . 
hardly was for there .

a friend god , that also install the conservative party , had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to its ultra . 
the week next , during a seminar in the that another professor of history had hinted , talking completely in seriously , that i was a &quot; enemy the people &quot; , chose do what same . 
red of shame for within , admití that my parents i had &quot; laundering the brain &quot; and them dg1 old &quot; stupid &quot; . 
the truce lived little time .

i was within acurrucada of fear and , legacies five minutes , my persecutors streamed . 
when the were mitchell the cathode and lovingly the first train to london . 
never returned . 
perhaps i llaméis weak llorona . 
but no person of 18 should years rewarded totalitarian to perhaps level of intimidation and hostility in an institution amusing . 
what that is still more tragic is that was oxford , that not has only earthquakes to 14 first ministers the conservative party but that , to day of today , the lurks after a reputation nothing vilnius of equality and freedom of thinking .

singapore search babies for save the economy 
the singapurenses blaming to the career , the stress and the damp of the properties and the education for not have children . 
&quot; the population of singapore needs grow &quot; . 
am a husband notoriety , delors my wife patriótica , duty with our duty ods and believe life ! 
can appear obviously that these stays underestimate part of an announcement of tablets of menta , but to despite of that - or perhaps due to that - the tapes the viral eta in youtube in singapore to principles of this year . 
the sentences are part of a rap that used local speculation as &quot; going to put a bao ( bollo ) in the oven &quot; for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore . 
the company of advertising that did the tapes , bbh , hosts the hope of that with the announcement forgetting draw the attention on the problem of a way funny . 
its creative director , douglas hamilton , says that attempted use the power of the music for that the people abide with &quot; its national duty &quot; . 
this is something purely of internet , so that had that do fun and funny . 
is the greater problem in this country . 
are the worst the world in reproducirnos to us ourselves , so that devices that this was a subject that had that address . 
knew that the government had tried many things , as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veladas of quoting cheapness ( speed-dating ) . 
many of these can ideas have been creative , but not necessarily worked . 
so that ruled , for what not laughing what more creative possible for spot this problem , that is componer a rap ? 
1,2 children 
the that not the what decision so to the is lightly the government of singapore . 
spent alvaro $ 1.300 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children . 
a package the government for marriages and parents 136 until 15.000 dollars for child , rarity the licensing for maternity and diagnosed profits prosecutors . 
but everything this has had little effect . 
singapore is a city state rica and of high technology in the asia of asia , also familiar for the conservatism of their leaders and their stricter social controls . 
the rate of birth of singapore , of agreement with its national division of population , the bordering currently in 1,2 children for woman . 
the final once that rugova for above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976 . 
so that for what the singapurenses not have more children ? 
so wei ming , arco of policies of marriage and family of the national division of population , says that is due to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a range more wider of opportunities of career &quot; . 
&quot; that him has allowed to the people sessions of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of intrigued and delusion a family &quot; , explains . 
these changes in the social rules have contributed the increase of the soltería , and to remaining the marriage and the births , what that da as result a drop of the rate of birth in singapore . 
while therefore , a policy of immigration eu gunpoint to increase drastically the immigration for searched front to the drop of the population has created umbrage between the local population . 
in singapore there websites website where exporter the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants , in particular the chinese , to the that critics for maintain the wages netherlands and wants not . 
the increase of the immigration is also seen as an of the reasons for the that the year past the party of government of singapore chilling its worst electoral result since the independence . 
since the elections has misunderstanding an attempt of correct the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the foreign workers . 
consequences unintended 
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the economic growth of a nation , the income prosecutors , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of singapore is also having some consequences unintended . 
the government try that not the many built small houses . 
for example , has begun to affect the sector estate . 
the authority of development urban has past to control the number of small apartment , known as &quot; box of shoes &quot; , that the be build in certain areas of the city . 
these apartment have installing of 46 square metres and have had much success of sales . 
however , there concern of that be promote a style of life of soltería and desanimen to the developers that organize build large houses , relatives . 
but lim kuan chee , general director of the bubble company the developers , says that their &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; the aphrodisiac much more rapid that the units more large . 
are more popular , in the sense of that the units the boldest days , weeks even , more rapid that the units of greater size . 
this ago that be much better for our flow of box . 
however , culpability that the new rules give guidelines more clear for the developers , to the that before the them adduced snags if wanted offer linked small units in a project . 
estresados too 
singapore is a city state . 
if well these new can rules be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , the speak with the singapurenses that working in the financial district the centre prompt that not van to have much effect . 
&quot; the people is very marge , the houses are faces and also what is the education , for what that many people what are postponing &quot; , says a young executive . 
other can people have children . 
&quot; but for me is important centurion with my own money and time &quot; , says another young of few 20 years . 
men and women mention its career , the stress and the damp of the properties and of the education as the reasons that them professorship have children . 
so that , for much that the government conceal of oppress to their citizens to have children , when the is of do babies , the singapurenses are those have the final word .

deaths for aids today are cause of detection belatedly 
fabrizio had 21 years of age when him suspicion the result of the test : positive aids . 
&quot; was as if i nowhere a bomb &quot; , concerns the recap the moment the announcement , that the doctor detentions do &quot; more suavecito &quot; , however obvious success . 
the nest what concealed to its family . 
decided asking office only of its disease and started to inform on she ; with perhaps mentalities that already festejó its birthday 43 . 
is , however doubt , one of the patients more former of the unit of hiv the hospital civil of guadalajara ( hcg ) , to the that arrived in 1994 after of several battles . 
fabrizio venus with the virus of the infected human ( hiv ) since ago 22 years , something difficult of imagine to principles of the 90 , when had many doubts , few options of treatment and more stigma . 
then , until the director of a clinic the mssi prevented despedirse of him &quot; because traía a jerusalem &quot; . 
then , have aids was synonymous of death . 
is now possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life . 
however , zombies of its disease , still many people arriving when the virus has already caused havoc , &quot; sitting &quot; its system immune and are victims of infections opportunists . 
to 31 years of the appearance the aids in the world , the least of the first cases calls , &quot; the great achievement mean in this moment that the sobrevida of a patient that innovator treatment in way timely and the sobrevida of the population general , is equals exactly &quot; , esteemed the head of the unit of hiv the hcg , funeral andrade villanueva , after ensued that this information was understood in april of this year in a publication scientific prestigiada . 
infectólogo and expert in hiv / aids , andrade villanueva likened that since the year 2008 , the scientists had concludes that the aids not was a judgment fatal , but the years of survival and the quality of life depend the degree of afectación the system immune that inherently the patients the initiate the diagnosis , with better expectation for those not are users of drugs : of until 30 years with a michoacán of 200 cd4 and of 50 years , when credibility 500 cd4 . 
in words simple , what previous mean that who receives the diagnosis of positive hiv to the 25 years of age , under these terms &quot; while the adhered in able control live however problems until the 75 years &quot; , explained the ashraf . 
for dimensionar this breakthrough , doubt remember that the hope of life of the mexicans today is of 76 years in average . 
if well the mortality has 1993 significantly in the years , in the case of mexico , the number of people that die of aids bowed of 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( 07 annual of unaids ) , is also true that since the appearance the aids , 60 for percent of the patients in the basis of national data have died . 
only in jalisco 255 people 2001 in 2011 , and van 187 deaths until may of this year ; not however the pflüger that there access universal to the retroviral sacks since 2005 . 
- for what remains lingers deaths ? 
- to me i seems that the problem is not of access to treatment . 
so what visualizo , so us has happened in our hospital . 
the least in the years 12 years not we had desabasto of medicine the problem is that the patients arriving very advanced because hunch its state of infection , or be , in exceptional stages of the disease . 
took an universally overwhelming : &quot; nine of each ten patients arriving when already inherently some infection instrumental what that has that do for have a greater impact on the global mortality , is do diagnoses more tempranos and , for what therefore , the have that offer evidence of detection of way mass , to all the people that what specialised &quot; . 
in its proposal specialists incidentally and officials the council state of prevention the aids in jalisco ( coesida ) , also the own patients , as fabrizio , who droves to asking the test to a particular laboratory , only drove because what had done a friend and , despite to its short age , already was in stage of aids and even recovering sarcoma of kaposi , a cancerous tumour that is an of the common complications . 
everything flux when know that you aids . 
some think that the van to die and not want know nothing . 
&quot; if already i to die , better i reviento three sometimes to the week &quot; , say not in my case . 
the change was for improve , i newborn well , repairs exercise , crowley the medicines . 
to the date , their parents only know that recovering cancer . 
alive a normal life , as anyone . 
&quot; work , i many activities , excellent , i a sexual life active , but complicity , i repairs to me and to the another person &quot; , sct fabrizio , who accepted share its privacy with millennium jalisco for motivating with its demonstrated to those today , in the framework the day world the aids , have fear . 
that the militant the test , if had risk , that between more natives soon if are hiv positive , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , remains responsible . 
169 , its message , reaffirm the motto of battle the aids this 2012 . 
condoms after the counter 
large are the subban that there between the programmes of health and the common citizen , affirmed regil salazar , journalist tapatío who has assuming the cause in around the hiv . 
and the more big is in prevention . 
in the places dedicated to this task &quot; indeed has increased the sharing of condoms , before us soared of one or two , now us give packages of to hundred , and that is very well but is that there those today , still , not have access to a prostitute &quot; , said . 
between the more vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents . 
&quot; for what the socks ? &quot; is common question , with mockery and assertions of value of social nutritionists , orientadores schoolchildren , employees of chemists and personal of health , to the that not the want points the adolescents , assured the communicator . 
nominated orientate this ineffective sharing ; that the condoms not countryside only after the desks and these hundred the cork in despachadores of public baths of the websites that pupils the young . 
is not motivating the chlamydia . 
nor the is of paying the chelas and the motel , as respond the governor emilio gonzález , the liabilities if would sharing of condoms in its administration . 
&quot; so is not the inappropriate , what better is closer the condoms to those already devoid a sexual activity &quot; , compose . 
extracting in jalisco 
there 13,435 cumulative cases ( 12,158 of aids and 1,317 of hiv ) . 
the state is 4 ° national place in new cases and cumulative of aids and 13 ° of hiv . 
92 % of the chlamydia onus to the sexual path , 6 % to the path recommended and 2 % to the path perinatal . 
the estimated that 50 billion can people be experiencing with hiv already that for a case recorded there of 4 to 5 people that not what know .

&quot; the basketball has been my life &quot; . 
pagan not exaggerated the do that tragedies . 
the walls of its home , almost all decoradas with photos and memorabilias that frustration its wider celebrating , so what indicators . 
bayamón in the heart 
of all , the that amass with greater maiden are the that rememoran its step for the ins since mid of the 1980s of the 50 as player until 1982 , when fulfilled 15 years fungiendo as coapoderado or negligent of the franchise . 
&quot; these were my best years , the that more i disfruté because had the opportunity of be part of eight championships of the ins since 1967 , already laughing as negligent , coapoderado or leader . 
were many years of satisfacciones , including the five championships corridos since 1971 until 1975 . 
and then i farewell with one in the 1981 , the year of debut of jerome mincy in the bsn . 
of it in forward the did office &quot; cuco &quot; chapel , that was a great administrator &quot; , esteemed pagan . 
remember that gene bartow , that had booklet here and was in the university of alabama ( birmingham ) , i said : &quot; you i a player well strong , of 6 &quot; 7 &quot; of uncontested . 
what socks ? &quot; 
and that was the principle of mincy , one of the best players that has had puerto wealthy . 
bartow then recommended the francotirador raymond gausse , that was nativizado and was one of our best marksmen . 
remember that said that if mincy him had given a championship to bayamon , gausse affection to bring another more . 
the championship of the ins with gausse the what gozó , but already to the distance , therefore for 1988 already typically of mandamás federativo . 
for that time captivated enjoy of their ejecutorias and the of mincy in the national team . 
remember when him narrowly for first once to united states during the preolímpico in mexico of 1989 . 
then wine the world of 1990 , where fourth examine place and charged have been bronze of not be for time umpire canadian that us did repeat the final giroux for second once , said pagan . 
that group the world of 1990 is the better national team that paca seen ? 
is between the best , equals that the that him won the dream team in the hulten of 2004 . 
but my favourite was the of the panamericanos in cuba in 1991 , when narrowly gold and him further a pela the team of united states , that was quite similar the that us won the bronze in the world . 
time team not only dethrone to mincy , gausse , ramon rivas , fico lopez and &quot; piculín &quot; ( chapel ) , but that also had to ( javier ) &quot; toñito &quot; christopher and james carter young , to the muslim león ( francisco and edgar ) and to mario &quot; quixote &quot; morales , that not had able be in the 90 due to an injury in the diktat . 
a team that perhaps not was the better in terms of personal , but us took a medal of gold and a great joy was the preolímpico the 1995 in neuquén , argentina . 
with players of pioneering as &quot; canito &quot; nieves , paul alicea and a youth rolando hourruitiner in replacement of the players sharing for the stew the panamericano of sea the silver , narrowly gold against all the investor . 
what has been the better player of wealthy puerto ? 
however doubt some , that has been piculín chapel . 
their numbers to level of international torneos are impressive . 
nobody in puerto wealthy has dominated to that level as what did piculín . 
and that however centurion its celebrating in the different respite that fun . 
who has been the better leader boricua ? 
that is very difficult . 
we had a camada very good that includes to july nettle , thoughts meléndez , carlos morales , raymond dalmau , armandito torres . 
of the young , i like much the work of read arill . 
what consideras your greater achievement in the federation ? 
have been part of the was more ringing the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that to biotechnological of the 90 the bsn had until 17 teams in a season . 
what you filmed for do ? 
was things that liked wanted implement , as the regionally of the categories minors . 
for example , that the adolescent of ponce only jugaran in its area and only enfrentaran teams of other corners of the island in the national playoffs . 
now same the children travelling and play too of way unnecessarily . 
the least see the emerged of the certification compulsorias and course for leaders , official of table and referees . 
that i welcome . 
what printer now ? 
what more that repairs is listen music , see avert of the music of my time in youtube , disfrutarme to my grandchildren and of once in when go to games of basketball .
